Assuming a 2% average lift in interest rates in 2023, this alone could add $160 million in pretax income, or about 20 cents in earnings per share, he said.</p><p></p><p>The Baird analyst raised his price target on Block to $78 from $62, implying a gain of roughly 20% from its current level of about $64. </p> <p>Truist’s Jeffrey had stuck with a Hold rating on PayPal because “our long-held view is that consensus [on long-term organic revenue growth] has been too aggressive,” considering the payments company’s market-share losses to Apple Pay, Amazon Pay, and Google Pay, he said. </p> <p>But now expectations have been reset amid the market-share loss. Truist expects PayPal’s revenue to increase 10.3% in calendar 2023. The consensus call among analysts tracked by FactSet is now for 9.2% growth, compared with 15.1% at the end of 2021.</p> <p>Jeffrey also pointed to PayPal’s net cash position of more than $6 billion, as reported in the company’s third-quarter filing, which creates flexibility to buy back shares or acquire companies. </p> <p>The two analysts’ calls add to the already bullish view on the Street.

Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images    </div> <p>After years of painful waiting, Tesla short sellers finally got to reap the benefit of those bets against the stock. Not only was Tesla stock a big winner for the shorts in 2022, but it might also have been among the bigger wins short sellers’ have had. </p> <p>Tesla (ticker: TSLA) shares dropped roughly 65% this past year. It’s the worst yearly performance for the stock ever, which wasn’t difficult to do given that shares had only finished lower in a calendar year once before—in 2016 when they dipped about 11%. </p> <div> <p>The 2022 decline was a boon to short sellers, who borrow stock they don’t own and sell it, hoping for a price decline so they can buy the borrowed stock back at a lower price. </p> <p>Tesla short sellers ended up earning about $16 billion in mark-to-market profits, up 84% based on average short interest in Tesla stock of about $19 billion, says Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of short selling research and data provider S3 Partners, which started tracking short selling in 2016. “Short seller’s [$16 billion] mark-to-market profits is the largest [one year profit] we have tracked.”</p> <p>Short sellers have been shorting stock for longer than 2016, but the numbers have been getting bigger as markets move higher. Apple (AAPL) was the most valuable company in the U.S. in 2016 with a market capitalization of under $500 billion. The 2001 bankruptcy of Enron wiped out more than $60 billion in market capitalization, but short interest headed into the fall was a small percentage of stock available for trading. </p> <div> <div> <div> <div></div>  </div> </div> </div> <p>It looks like a record in what was a year of big losses in big companies. Declines in the so-called FAANG stocks—Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META), Apple, Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL)—totaled roughly $3.2 trillion. Tesla lost almost $900 billion in market capitalization in 2022. </p> <p>Tesla is the third most heavily shorted stock in the market, by dollar volume of stock sold short, behind Apple and Microsoft (MSFT), according to S3. </p> <p>The size of a stock has something to do with being “most heavily shorted.” The other way to measure how popular a short position is? Look at the short interest in a stock, defined as the number of shares sold short compared with the amount of stock outstanding or available for trading. </p> <p>Investors aren’t wildly bearish about Apple. The short interest is only about 1% of the shares available for trading. The Apple short interest “will never stray too far off 1% due to its extremely large [size],” says Dusaniwsky. That’s why he looks at the dollar value shorted along with short interest ratios. </p> <p>Given the stock performance and profits racked up by the bears, investors might assume something went badly wrong at Tesla. That isn’t the case. For 2022, delivery revenue will end up growing roughly 50% year over year, while earnings are expected to grow about 80% year over year. </p> <div></div> <p>But the market is forward looking and the recent stock price action indicates that investors are worried about future sales, earnings, and market share for the EV leader. </p> <p>Tesla is expected to deliver about 1.9 million cars in 2023, up from about 1.3 million in 2022. Earnings, profit margins, and free cash flow are expected to grow, based on Wall Street consensus estimates. Investors clearly aren’t buying into that rosy outcome. </p> <p>Tesla bulls can look to history for—a very small amount—of support. Declines in consecutive years are rare for a stock and stocks tend to bounce back after big drops. </p> <p>Apple stock has declined for consecutive years twice since 1980. What’s more, shares rose the year after relatively steep losses in 1993, 2000, and 2008.</p> <p> Ford Motor (F) stock, though, has more instances of back-to-back declines. Shares declined in consecutive years four times since 1980, with the worst occurring during a four-year starting in 1999. Still, shares rose in the years after the steepest yearly declines in 2005 and 2008. </p> <p>But the issues of 2022, including car industry headwinds, the overall market, and Twitter, aren’t going anywhere just yet. The market picked up in 2023 where it left off 2022, with the Nasdaq Composite falling 0.8% on the first trading day of the year after dropping about 34% in 2022. Tesla, though, tumbled 12% on Tuesday, its largest percentage drop since Sept 2020. </p> <p>Then there was Twitter. Tesla stock underperformed the Nasdaq by roughly 30 percentage points in the seven weeks following his purchase as investors weighed Musk’s stock sales, tweets, and time spent away from Tesla. </p> <p>The last part of the decline has been recent, driven by fear about the new car and EV market headed into 2023. Prices are falling, inventories are rising and investors wonder if buyers will pull back from new car purchases in a recession. Tesla stock dropped more than 35% in December, six times the S&amp;P 500‘s 6% drop, while Ford stock dropped more than 15%.</p> <p>Resolution to one or more of those issues would help the stock bounce in 2023. Or not. But as Musk tweeted out on New Year’s Day, it certainly won’t be boring. </p> <p>Write to Al Root at </p> </div></p>'}, {'publish_time': '2023-01-03 20:20:23', 'title': 'Need to replace the battery on your iPhone?

Markets largely prefer the status quo when it comes to major legislation. </li> </ul> <p>What’s Next: The midterm elections provided a higher chance of legislative deadlock over the next two years, with each chamber controlled by a different party, but the Republican revolt could make it even harder for the party to impose its agenda.

UC Investments, which manages $150 billion, including retirement assets for employees and endowment money, committed to six years. </li> <li> It is unusual for an investment manager to offer performance support to a big investor, and ordinary investors in BREIT don’t get that support. It isn’t a guarantee, though.

Exxon will spend similarly in New Mexico and West Texas, Guyana, Brazil, and liquefied natural-gas projects.

West Texas Intermediate settled 4.2% lower, and Brent crude for March delivery was down 4.4% on concerns about slowing economic growth. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is cutting output quotas to help keep prices higher. </li> <li> Natural gas futures closed below $4 a million British thermal units for the first time since February amid unusually temperate weather across much of the U.S., MarketWatch reported.

I have been dating this person for 17 years, we have been engaged for six years and have lived together for close to nine years. </p> <p>I moved into her house and we agreed on $600 monthly rent. Over the years, I have increased how much I have paid in rent, and I have taken on other expenses such as the $300 cable-and-internet bill, and I have contributed to some home improvements (about $10,000 in total).</p> <p>Additionally, when we go out to dine, which is probably 60% of the time, I usually pay. </p> <p>I am now paying $1,100 a month in rent. She has retired and is listed as a domestic partner on my insurance. I am also paying the $200 health-insurance premium.</p> <p>However, her previous company is reimbursing her health insurance, and she is keeping that money. She says she “subsidized” my rent nine years ago to help me out financially, and this is now “payback” since I am debt-free. </p> <p>The cherry on top is that we both have a trust, and she refuses to tell me any details about it. If she were to die tomorrow I literally would be in the dark. With mine, she knows all the specifics, including the fact that she is included in it. </p> <p>Am I crazy to feel this about the rent, health insurance and the trust?</p> <p>—Appreciate Your Guidance</p> <p> </p> <p>Read The Moneyist’s response here.</p> <p>—Quentin Fottrell</p> ***    <p>—Newsletter edited by Liz Moyer, Patrick O’Donnell, Rupert Steiner</p> </div></p>'}, {'publish_time': '2023-01-03 23:43:00', 'title': 'Nvidia And Foxconn Joined Forces To Build Autonomous Vehicles', 'content': '<p><div><div><div><div></div><ul> <li>Chipmaker Nvidia Corp NVDA and key Apple Inc AAPL supplier Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd HNHPF Foxconn collaborated to develop autonomous vehicle platforms.</li> <li>Foxconn will be a tier-one manufacturer, producing electronic control units (ECUs) based on NVIDIA DRIVE Orin for the global automotive market. </li> <li>Foxconn-manufactured electric vehicles (EVs) will feature DRIVE Orin ECUs and DRIVE Hyperion sensors for highly automated driving capabilities.</li> <li>Also Read: </li> <li>The  will allow NVIDIA to scale its efforts further and meet growing industry demand as more transportation leaders select DRIVE Orin for intelligent vehicles. </li> <li>In addition, by building EVs on the DRIVE Hyperion-qualified sensor set, Foxconn will speed up its time-to-market and time-to-cost strategies.</li> <li>""Our partnership with Foxconn will provide OEMs developing intelligent driving solutions with a world-class supplier that can scale for volume manufacturing of the NVIDIA DRIVE Orin platform,"" said Rishi Dhall, vice president of automotive at NVIDIA. </li> <li>""Foxconn&#039;s decision to also use the DRIVE Hyperion sensor suite for its EVs will help accelerate their path to production without compromising safety, reliability or quality.""</li> <li>Price Action: NVDA shares closed lower by 2.05% at $143.15 on Tuesday.</li> </ul><div></div><div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div>  </div><p></p><div></div></div></div></div></p>'}, {'publish_time': '2023-01-04 00:13:00', 'title': 'Leading Contract Chipmaker TSMC Fails To Impress Analysts', 'content': '<p><div><div><div><div></div><ul> <li>Wall Street banks shifted to a bearish stance on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd TSM, cautioning that the biggest chipmaker will issue conservative guidance for its revenue outlook due to weak demand. </li> <li>The primary Apple Inc AAPL supplier will likely report earnings for the last quarter on January 12, Bloomberg reports. </li> <li>Both Goldman Sachs Group, Inc GS and UBS Group AG UBS expect TSMC&#039;s sales to be flat in 2023, with UBS slashing its price target by 7.4%. </li> <li>""TSMC is not immune to the industry inventory digestion and end-demand correction into 2023,"" UBS analysts noted.

Here are some predictions from Loup Ventures and its Managing Partner Gene Munster.</p><p>What Happened: The SPDR S&amp;P 500 Global ETF SPY had its worst performance since 2008 in 2022, down over 19%.</p><p>The down year for the S&amp;P 500 and many sectors could make it hard to predict what’s ahead for stocks in 2023. Munster shared his annual predictions for the year ahead, with a focus mainly on the technology sector. For more on Munster’s 2023 thoughts, check out his interview with Benzinga on PreMarketPrep below.</p><div></div><div></div><p>Munster’s Predictions:</p><p>1. The FAANG stocks will outperform the S&amp;P 500 in 2023: FAANG is one of the most commonly used stock acronyms and covers the companies of Meta Platforms META, Apple Inc AAPL, Amazon.com Inc AMZN, Netflix Inc NFLX and Alphabet Inc GOOGGOOGL. These stocks were down 48% in 2022, turning in a worse performance than the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>“The reason why we are optimistic on FAANG is that these companies continue to operate high-quality, generational business. In 2022, most FAANG names have not experienced an impairment to their core business,” Munster said.</p><div><div><div></div></div></div><div>  </div><p></p><p>Related Link: Gene Munster Tells Benzinga Where He Thinks Tech Will Go In 2023 </p><p>2. Apple will unveil mixed reality headset in late 2023: A repeat of a 2022 prediction by Munster, the managing partner thinks 2023 will be the year that Apple unveils its new headset. Munster thinks sales could start in 2024 for the device, with a $3,000 price target and an initial target market of developers.</p><p>3. Tesla delay announcement of Model 2: One of the big catalysts many are calling for with electric vehicle giant Tesla Inc TSLA is a more affordable vehicle. Munster thinks Tesla will delay the announcement of the Model 2 until 2024.</p><p>“If the company announces the lower priced car too early, they risk slowing sales of Model 3, while ramping capacity during what is likely to be a broader auto recession,” Munster said.</p><p>Munster said it is more likely that a preview of the Model 2 happens in 2024 with the product releasing in 2025.</p><p>4. F-150 Lightning will outsell Cybertruck: The highly anticipated electric pickup truck from Tesla is expected to launch in 2023 and could have over 80,000 deliveries. While the total is high, Munster sees Ford Motor Company F having over 100,000 deliveries of its electric pickup truck in 2023.</p><p>“In 2024, however, we look for the tables to turn when Cybertruck production is fully ramped,” Munster said.</p><p>The Cybertruck has reservations listed as high as 1.5 million units by some estimates.</p><p>5. Electric vehicles sales could disappoint: One prediction by Munster is that 2023 could be a disappointing year for electric vehicles as a result of the overall car market being hit. In 2022, electric vehicles made up around 6% of all new car sales. Munster sees that figure growing to 10%, but overall electric vehicle growth to be slower than some are anticipating.</p><p>6. Private equity will take several technology companies private: Valuations of technology stocks were hit in 2022 and Munster sees the result turning into some buyout candidates in 2023. Munster anticipates at least five deals done in the technology sector valued at $2 billion or more by private equity.</p><p>7. Some unicorns could go bankrupt: Along with valuations of public companies getting hit in 2022, private companies also saw valuations fall. Munster mentions Instacart going from a $39 billion valuation to $10 billion. The term unicorn refers to a private company valued at $1 billion or more. Munster sees the number of unicorns shrinking to less than 125 by the end of 2023, down from 750 in the middle of 2022 and 200 by the end of last year.</p><p>8. Macro thoughts: Outside of the technology predictions, Munster sees the potential of a deeper recession or “none at all.”</p><p>“The current consensus of a mild recession is unlikely according to the current and upcoming macro data along with potential revisions to past data, including jobs numbers,” Munster said.</p><p>Munster sees the market ending 2023 higher than the start of the year.</p><p>2022 Predictions: Along with the updated 2023 predictions, Munster success rate of the predictions from 2022.</p><p>1. Apple and Meta will be top performing FAANG stock: miss, Apple best performing, Meta worst performing.</p><p>2. Apple previews mixed reality headset: miss, see above</p><p>3. Electric Vehicle theme cools off: hit, many EV names down over 50%</p><p>4. Tesla 1.2 million deliveries, Rivian and Lucid will miss: hit</p><p>5. Quantum computing theme gets hot: hit</p><p>6. Sony Group Corp SONY will launch PSVR 2 headset: miss, coming in 2023</p><p>7.

Futures are inching higher this morning after a sloppy start to the year, with Wall Street darlings Apple and Tesla adding to souring sentiment. We&#039;ll talk about what that means for the broader market and whether they&#039;re coming back today.</p> <div></div> <p>BRIAN SOZZI: Plus, showdown in Washington. Kevin McCarthy failed to gain the votes needed to become Speaker of the House with voting set to resume at noon today. We&#039;ve got the latest on the DC drama.</p> <p>BRAD SMITH: And the bumpy ride, Tesla shares closed at their lowest levels in two years yesterday after the automaker missed on deliveries for the third straight quarter. We&#039;re going to speak to one bearish tech investor about what might come next for the battered EV manufacturer.</p> <p>BRIAN SOZZI: But we begin today with our top story. Apple&#039;s market cap sank below $2 trillion for the first time since June 2021, marking a notable fall from grace for the tech giant as inflation and weaker economic conditions stoked demand fears. Apple is the last major company to surrender its $2 trillion valuation after Microsoft and Saudi Aramco both slipped from the mark last year.</p> <p>And the stats are just, I would say, stunning. Outside of just the optics of this $2 trillion mark, we have Apple shares now down 15% in the past month alone. The company&#039;s not come out with any release. They have not won in earnings. They have not pulled a Salesforce and cut workers, like we saw from Salesforce this morning. Yet, there&#039;s a lot of concerns out there, mostly driven by fears about the China reopening on how Apple fared in that December quarter.</p> <p>JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, and what&#039;s interesting about Apple is it held up relatively well for most of last year. And indeed, if you look at the 2022 performance for Apple, it fell, but it didn&#039;t fall as much as some of its large cap tech peers, right? What really changed is in the last month, when it really started to accelerate to the downside, and then outpaced on the downside the NASDAQ&#039;s fall, for example, the NASDAQ 100, which was down about 9% over the month of December. Apple was down 12% in the month of December.</p> <div> Story continues </div> <p>And it does have to do with some of these demand concerns and concerns about what&#039;s going on in China. The question is whether the demand will just be delayed or eliminated, which is frequently the question with Apple, right? So is it just that some of its iPhone sales will be pushed out further or that people just won&#039;t get the phones at all?</p> <p>BRAD SMITH: Yeah, and on the front of that demand, it really just comes back to where Apple finds itself in this cycle and for the next supercycle that can emerge, especially within that iPhone category, which is more than half of its overall revenue and net sales at the end of the day across product categories. You saw weakness in iPad. Perhaps that&#039;s an area where they&#039;re going to continue to have to account for some of that weakness, year over year declines there.</p> <p>But one other part of the business that continues to hold up well and where investors might be trying to get ahead of any kind of pullback in some of those consumer discretionary dollars in platform is the services business. And that services business continues to exhibit growth. It didn&#039;t quite hit $80 billion run rate last year, but you&#039;re looking at a services business on a quarterly revenue basis that is bringing in more than the equivalent of market caps of companies like Spotify and Snap and Take-Two Interactive, all of those areas where Apple, of course, does want to play in one facet or another.</p> <p>BRIAN SOZZI: I mean, are we at that point? Are we nearing that point where we can say Apple shares might be oversold. Dan Ives, this guy&#039;s been on fire this morning, publishing notes on Salesforce, Apple, and Tesla. But I like what he said on Apple. He said it looks, based on his channel checks, that demand for the iPhone looks to be stable. Now he is seeing some cuts in the supply chain for Macs, other devices that Apple produces. But if that iPhone demand is stable, that is usually the driver of Apple stock. So is it just oversold here?</p> <p>JULIE HYMAN: It could be. I mean, the valuation is-- it&#039;s still trading above its long-term average. I think it&#039;s trading at about 20 times forward earnings. But one more thing you can look at is the expectations. The company is set to report its earnings towards the end of the month. And here are the first quarter revenue estimates--</p> <p>BRIAN SOZZI: Wow.</p> <p>JULIE HYMAN: --from analysts. And you can see the decline here that we have seen in--</p> <p>BRIAN SOZZI: It&#039;s huge.</p> <p>JULIE HYMAN: --the numbers. Yes, definitely. So that&#039;s something to keep in mind. I think that should be millions, instead of thousands, but you get the general idea.</p> <p>BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, positive if you&#039;re trading Apple into earnings. Of course, this is now what they would say a lower bar to beat. You know, Apple would come out here with a penny beat, and maybe the stock would go up.</p> <p>BRAD SMITH: Yeah, absolutely. We&#039;re going to keep a close eye on shares of megacap tech, but especially AAPL.</p></p>'}, {'publish_time': '2023-01-04 12:55:00', 'title': 'Apple Stock Active As Wedbush Sees Demand Headwinds, Lowers Price Target', 'content': '<p>Updated at 12:10 pm EST Apple (AAPL) - Get Free Report shares moved higher Wednesday, after closing below the $2 trillion market value threshold for the first time in nearly two years, as Wedbush analyst Dan Ives cautions that demand headwinds could challenge the stock&#039;s near-term growth prospects. Ives clipped $25 from his Apple price target, lowering it to $175 per share, but held his &#039;overweight&#039; rating in place amid what he described as ""mixed"" supply chain checks and the possibility of reduced Mac and iPad orders and stable iPhone 14 demand. Supply chain pressures linked to the Foxconn-operating &#039;iPhone City&#039; plant in Zhengzhou, China will likely push between 8 million and 10 million iPhone units into the March quarter, Ives said, although he stressed that the current demand environment is ""more resilient than the Street is anticipating"" and largely reflected in Apple&#039;s recent share slide. Apple stock has fallen nearly 10% over the past two months, compared to a modest 2.8% gain for the S&amp;P 500. That view appears to be supported by data from JPMorgan, which noted Wednesday that U.S. carriers increased their iPhone sales over the month of November even as supplies of higher-end iPhone 14 Pro models remained pressured from supply chain disruptions. Stocks Edge Higher, Fed Minutes, GE, Microsoft, House Speaker Vote - Five Things To Know ""While tech stocks remain enemy #1 on the Street now in the rising rate environment/hawkish Fed, Apple remains the laser focus of the tech bears as this name has held up much better than the rest of the beaten down tech sector over the past year,"" Ives said. ""To this point, we believe Apple has a unique installed base demand story that can withstand the Category 5 macro pressures around the corner better than its tech peers and should remain a Rock of Gibraltar name into 2023."" ""On a sum-of-the-parts valuation we continue to believe $200 is the right valuation for Apple reflecting its core services business with a base case valuation in the $175 range,"" he added. ""We are lowering our price target from $200 to $175 reflecting a more base case valuation in this uncertain environment as some demand headwinds starts to creep into the Cupertino growth story."" Apple shares were marked 2.36% higher in early afternoon trading Wednesday $128.03 each. The stock closed at $125.07 last night, slipping below the $2 trillion market cap threshold for the first time since March of 2021. Other analysts, however, are concerned that a pullback in consumer spending, alongside still uncertain supply chain forecasts, will will soften December earnings for the world&#039;s biggest tech company. Exane BNP analyst Jerome Romel cut his rating on Apple stock to &#039;neutral&#039;, from &#039;outperform&#039;, and lowered his price target by $40 to a share to $180 each, in a Tuesday note that highlighted weakened iPhone and Mac shipment estimates and cautious consumer spending. Romel&#039;s views partly echo concerns expressed late last month by JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee, who lowered his Apple price target by $10 to $190 per share while noting that the ongoing Covid disruption in China would take some 4 million from the tech giant&#039;s December iPhone sales, which he pegs at around 70 million.
