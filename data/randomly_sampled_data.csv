Executives from Pfizer, Google, Deloitte, Estée Lauder, and EeroQ give advice', 'content': ""Executives from Pfizer, Google, Deloitte, Estée Lauder, and EeroQ during a panel moderated by Fortune's Jennifer Fields. Photograph by Kim Utley/Fortune Consumers want the companies they support to have a purpose; employees want the companies they work for to have a purpose. But defining what your company stands for can be complicated. Executives from Deloitte, Google, Pfizer, Estée Lauder, and EeroQ shared their advice during a panel discussion on Tuesday at the Fortune Most Powerful Women Summit in Laguna Niguel, Calif. Pfizer employees rose to the occasion Angela Hwang, Pfizer’s chief commercial officer and president of the global biopharmaceuticals business, began by explaining that a company’s purpose gives its employees the motivation and energy to do impossible things, and she’s clearly speaking from experience given her company’s role in developing its COVID-19 vaccine in the midst of the pandemic. “When you think about an industry like the pharmaceutical industry, where our entire reason to be in this is about bringing breakthroughs that can change patient’s lives—that actually is our purpose, it’s easy to wake up every single day and say what am I doing?” Hwang said. “It’s so incredibly powerful [to] have a very clear sense of your objectives.” Pfizer’s purpose, and purpose-driven strategies, were set in place before it really had to rise to the occasion, but when it came time, its employees were ready. Her overarching message seems to be: give people a reason to want to fulfill the company’s purpose through meaningful work. Hwang also stressed that a company’s purpose and philosophy should be enduring, despite the fact that we live in an ever-evolving society. What should change, or evolve, is a company’s strategies, and how it goes about fulfilling its purpose. Google’s singular mission Google’s mission is to make all of the world’s information universally accessible and useful, Lisa Gevelber, founder of Grow with Google and chief marketing officer of Google, explained. That means ensuring that the opportunities created by technology are available to everyone. “We had a single minded mission, which was around making economic security accessible to everyone,” Gevelber said, of the purpose behind Grow with Google. In just two years, she said, they’ve helped more than 600,000 people, with their training and certification program, move up from low-wage jobs—a product of “single minded focus on this purpose.” Having a purpose really became crucial a few years ago, Lara Abrash, Deloitte’s board chair, explained—and that’s when younger, Gen Z talent decided they wanted to work for a company that shares their values. Still, when you think about purpose, she said, it can’t just be a broad vision. “You really have to think about where do I want to go, but [also] how do I bring all these constituents along the way?” Abrash said. Estée Lauder builds brand identity Estée Lauder’s purpose started with Jane Lauder’s grandmother, who founded the company in 1946. Lauder, now the company’s executive vice president of enterprise marketing and chief data officer, explained that the purpose is to put the power of possibility in the palm of every hand. But, because it’s a company of brands, each brand has its own purpose, consumer, and brand DNA. MAC is all about diversity and inclusivity, she said, while Aveda is very climate and environment-focused. But the way that Estée Lauder engages all its brands is through the purpose of their parent company, Lauder said. As for Faye Wattleton, co-founder and executive vice president of EeroQ, she founded her company knowing that its technology could engage with every aspect of society. “We are on the precipice, on the forefront of changing humanity as we know it through the power of quantum computing, not as an extension of classic computing, but a new science,” Wattleton said. In her view, purpose means having a big vision. Subscribe to Well Adjusted, our newsletter full of simple strategies to work smarter and live better, from the Fortune Well team.

Apple Pay, Google Pay and China\'s WeChat Pay, which have grown rapidly in recent years, are not currently designated as payment systems, putting them outside Australia\'s financial regulatory system. The proposed rules would enable the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to monitor digital wallet payments in the same way as credit card networks and other transactions. It would also give powers to the treasurer to order regulators to check if any payment platforms pose risks to the country. ""(The) government is addressing the risks posed by new digital payment services, which are currently unregulated, to protect consumers, promote competition and spur innovation,"" Treasurer Jim Chalmers said in a statement. The draft law would expand the definitions of ""payment system"" and ""participant"" in Australia\'s existing laws, treasury documents showed. Payments infrastructure and the regulatory framework have not kept pace with transitions in finance, particularly in Australia\'s digital economy and payments. In a June report, the Australian Banking Association said it was witnessing a ""phenomenal shift"" in payment preferences in recent years, with the number of mobile wallet transactions in the country surging to 2.4 billion in 2022, from 29.2 million in 2018. Google and Apple have been opposing the government\'s move to designate them as payment providers, saying customers only use their phones to use cards issued by banks to make payments. Apple declined to comment on the draft law and instead referred to a submission it made to the treasury in July, when it said any reforms ""should be proportionate to the limited, indirect role"" digital services had in the payment system. Google did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment. The government has sought feedback from stakeholders on the draft legislation until Nov. 1. The legislation is expected to be introduced to parliament this year.

And Google doesn\'t want you to forget it. Google today announced that Cloud Spanner, its distributed, decoupled relational database service hosted on Google Cloud, is now more efficient in terms of both compute and storage, delivering what Google describes as ""significant"" cost savings for customers. Cloud Spanner\'s read throughput has been increased by 50%. And each Spanner node -- that is, collections of compute resources, namely CPUs, RAM and storage -- can now accommodate 10 terabytes of storage compared to 4 TB previously. The upgrades will be rolled out to all Spanner customers in the coming months, Google says, and are available to select regional and multiregion instance configurations as of today. Storage upgrades will follow in the weeks ahead. In a very pointed blog post, Google draws comparisons to Amazon\'s DynamoDB, which Google claims processes 126 million queries per second at peak compared to Spanner\'s 3 billion queries per second. ""With these changes, Spanner now offers up to 2x better read throughput per dollar compared to Amazon DynamoDB for similar workloads,"" Google product manager Jagdeep Singh and engineering director Pritam Shah wrote in the blog post, without elaborating on the ""similar workloads"" bit. But this is a little disingenuous. Google lifted the ""126 million"" figure from Amazon\'s recent Prime Day blog post, which reveals that AmazonDB-powered, Amazon-owned properties and systems powered made 126 million requests per second at peak. But that\'s not DynamoDB\'s theoretical throughput ceiling -- only a measure of Prime Day traffic. In point of fact, I had a hard time finding a maximum queries per second figure for DynamoDB. Amazon doesn\'t make it easy. That\'s not to suggest Cloud Spanner is less capable than Google\'s marketing materials make it out to be. AWS documentation from 2021 suggests that DynamoDB can indeed handle only ""millions"" of queries per second at peak, not billions. But as often is the case, the truth is murkier than the press release suggests. Story continues Speaking of: Google\'s assertion that Cloud Spanner is now ""half the cost"" of DynamoDB. That depends very much on the workload (which Google acknowledges, to its credit). A production-ready Cloud Spanner instance starts at $65 per month, but DynamoDB can run for virtually nothing with per-request pricing. Google\'s stepped-up rhetoric comes as the search giant angles to make headway against the dominant AWS in the public cloud market. Google Cloud\'s market share stands at 11% as of Q4 2022, up from 6% in Q4 2017 (the year Cloud Spanner launched, coincidentally). But AWS far and away leads with 34%. It\'s worth noting that Google Cloud is in objectively better shape than it once was. In Q2, the Google division\'s revenue rose 28% to more than $8 billion, marking Google Cloud\'s second straight profitable quarter.

Emails Mr Pichai wrote in 2007 to Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, among other executives, were introduced as evidence in the US Justice Department’s antitrust case against Alphabet’s Google, which is underway in Washington. Sundar Pichai is the CEO of Google’s parent company, Alphabet. AP The emails, written when Mr Pichai was in charge of Google’s Chrome browser, show concerns about the company’s agreement to pay Apple in exchange for being the pre-selected search option on the Safari browser. “I know we are insisting on default, but at the same time I think we should encourage them to have Yahoo as a choice in the pull down or some other easy option,” he wrote of the agreement, which is at the centre of the government’s case. “I don’t think it is a good user experience nor the optics is great for us to be the only provider in the browser.” The Justice Department and state attorneys general allege that Google has paid Apple and smartphone makers including Samsung billions of dollars in revenue-sharing agreements to keep rival search engines from gaining users. The deals offer a percentage of the revenue Google makes from search-based advertising in exchange for being the default tool on browsers and smartphones. The Justice Department says Google pays more than $US10 billion a year in these contracts, although the exact figures remain confidential. Google denies that the agreements harm competition and says it’s easy for consumers to switch to alternatives if they want. Joan Braddi, Google’s vice president for product partnerships and the key negotiator of the Apple agreement, was one of the executives copied on Mr Pichai’s emails. ‘Propping up’ Apple? She was called as a witness by the Justice Department on Tuesday and asked about the exchanges. Prosecutor Adam Severt also asked whether the benefits to Google search are worth the cost of propping up Apple, the company’s biggest rival in mobile operating system software. Advertisement “I don’t know that we’ve ever looked at it that way,” Ms Braddi, who has worked for Google for 24 years and was among its first employees, said. The agreement between Google and Apple places no limits on how the iPhone maker uses the money, she said, adding that she is “sure” Apple has used the payments to improve its iOS product, which competes with Google’s Android operating system. Ms Braddi negotiated Google’s original 2002 deal with Apple to make its search engine the default on the Mac’s Safari browser. The original agreement contained no money, but the companies amended it in 2005 to add a revenue-share. The deal later expanded to the iPhone in 2007 and the iPad in 2010. Other options In 2007, 2009 and 2012, Apple proposed amendments to the deal that would have allowed it “more flexibility” on the search default, Ms Braddi testified. In 2014, the companies signed another amendment that allowed Apple to use other search engines in some countries, Ms Braddi said. Today, Safari uses non-Google search engines in Russia, China and South Korea. Advertisement The 2014 amendment took 17 months to negotiate, Ms Braddi said, because it included aspects related to intellectual property and mapping services. At the time, Google was concerned that Apple might try to divert queries to other companies — like Amazon or Yelp — in exchange for additional shares of revenue from those companies instead of sending searches to Google, according to a 2013 email exchange between the two companies. That concern was what led Google to ask for a clause that requires Apple to use the search engine in a “substantially similar” manner to how it had previously, she said, adding that it was not an effort to block Apple from expanding its own services. Mr Severt asked Ms Braddi if Google pays “a significant amount of money” to Apple for the Safari revenue-share. “It wasn’t always,” she said. “But today, yes.” Since 2018, Google has monitored Apple’s earnings calls and measured how much the revenue-share contributes to the iPhone maker’s operating income, Ms Braddi said. The exact figures remain sealed. Advertisement Ms Braddi declined to say whether she would characterise the revenue-share as a “meaningful” percentage of Apple’s operating income. “I’m not a finance person,” she said. --With assistance from Mark Gurman.

It’s how we make money. But our editorial integrity ensures our experts’ opinions aren’t influenced by compensation. Terms may apply to offers listed on this page. Texas recently eliminated sales tax on period products and some family care products. By no longer having to pay sales tax on necessary items like tampons, pads, diapers, and baby bottles, Texas residents can keep more money in their pockets. Check out our pick for Best No Annual Fee Credit Card of 2023 A recent law that could save many Texans a significant amount of money went into effect. As of Sept. 1, menstrual and baby care products will no longer be taxed. Shoppers were previously charged a 6.25% sales tax when buying these items. But a state tax-relief bill that passed earlier this year has now made eligible purchases tax free. The tampon tax is no more in Texas Texas joins 23 other U.S. states and the District of Columbia in eliminating sales tax on menstrual products. Before a recent state law was signed into law, such products were classified as optional -- despite being very much a necessity for many people statewide. But since Sept. 1, these products are considered essential and are tax free. Products such as tampons, menstrual cups, and menstrual pads will no longer be taxed. This news is a significant win for the bank accounts of Texans. Over time, the savings will add up. In addition, some family care items will no longer be taxed. Diapers are one typical expense parents pay for that was taxed until recently. But as of Sept. 1, they're no longer taxed. Other eligible tax-free family care items include baby wipes, baby bottles, breast milk pumps, and maternity clothing. Preparing for and caring for young children can be extremely expensive, so this is welcome news for parents of babies and those currently expecting. According to research from the Texas Diaper Bank, an organization that supplies diapers to families in need, it costs $125 per month to diaper a baby. That's $1,500 a year to diaper one child. Considering the annual cost of diapers for one child, Texas parents will now save $93.75 per year by no longer having to pay tax on this necessary purchase. Hopefully, more states will implement tax-saving changes like this. Imposing taxes on necessary products like diapers and pads makes every day more costly for the average person. By making items like this tax free, Americans can feel some relief at the checkout aisle and may be less likely to go without the personal care products they need. Four ways to save money when buying everyday essentials Whether buying tampons, diapers, toilet paper, milk, or bread, you may be looking for ways to keep more money in your pocket. By being strategic when you shop, you can save some money and earn rewards. Here are a few tips: Shop sale items and compare prices. Before making your weekly shopping list, review local retailers' sales fliers. You can keep your spending to a minimum by purchasing store-brand items and sale items. It's also a good idea to compare prices from other nearby stores to get the best deal. Become a warehouse club member. By joining a warehouse club like Costco, you could save money by purchasing items in bulk. You'll get a deal and be stocked up for a while, which could help you save time by minimizing trips to the store. Use cash back apps. You can earn cash back when you shop by using one of the best cash back apps. These apps reward you for making eligible purchases. While you won't get an immediate discount on your shopping bill, you can later cash out your earnings. Use rewards credit cards. When you use rewards credit cards, you can earn points, miles, or cash back. You'll accumulate rewards as you spend money with your credit cards, and you can later redeem your rewards to pay yourself back for everyday purchases.

It’s how we make money. But our editorial integrity ensures our experts’ opinions aren’t influenced by compensation. Terms may apply to offers listed on this page. KEY POINTS It makes sense to buy Halloween candy in bulk if you tend to give out a lot of it. Costco has competitive prices, but if you only get a few trick-or-treaters, you might end up wasting money on a bulk bag or getting stuck with more sugar than you want. Check out our pick for Best No Annual Fee Credit Card of 2023 The other day, I was buying groceries at Costco when I spotted giant bags of Halloween candy on display. At first, I was somewhat horrified given that it was still early September and my kids hadn\'t even started school yet. But then I remembered that the Pumpkin Spice Latte was already back at Starbucks despite it being 90 degrees out. So clearly, the marketing people who make these decisions no longer care about waiting until the appropriate season to peddle their wares. Now, I didn\'t pick up any Halloween candy on this particular Costco trip for one big reason. If I bring home a giant sack of assorted goodies, my kids will ransack that stash in short order. So I\'d rather wait until closer to Halloween to stock up on candy. Still, when I\'m ready to buy my Halloween candy, Costco will most likely be my go-to source. Whether the same should hold true for you, however, depends on your situation. Why Costco may not be your best bet Let\'s get one thing out of the way. Any time you buy grocery items in bulk, you\'re likely to save money on a per-ounce or per-unit basis, regardless of what you\'re purchasing. Candy is no exception. As such, I\'m not going to compare the cost of a Costco-sized bag of candy to a smaller bag with 12 pieces. There\'s just no comparison. A 90-ounce bag of mixed chocolate miniatures that include M&Ms, Twix, and Reese\'s will cost you $22.99 at Costco if you buy it online. That\'s just $0.26 per ounce of candy. And you might spend even less if you buy it in-store. Meanwhile, a five-pound variety pack of chocolates that includes some of the same ones in the Costco assortment will cost you $45.95 on Amazon. That\'s $0.57 per ounce. So from a bulk pricing perspective, Costco is the clear winner (though to be fair, Amazon has many candy assortments on offer, so if you dig around the site long enough, you might find a better deal there). But while Costco\'s price for bulk candy is clearly competitive, the reality is that you probably don\'t want to buy your Halloween candy there unless you\'re absolutely certain you\'re going to need a lot of it. If your neighborhood is filled with children and you tend to get a lot of people knocking on your door asking for candy, then sure, spring for a bulk bag from Costco. But if you tend to get just a handful of trick-or-treaters, then you\'re probably better off getting your Halloween candy from a regular supermarket. Even if you end up spending four times as much on a per-ounce basis for candy, you\'re better off running up a $6 credit card tab if you don\'t eat a lot of candy or simply don\'t want a lot of it sitting in your kitchen, and you don\'t expect to have enough trick-or-treaters to use up a bulk bag. Heck, my neighborhood gets tons of trick-or-treaters, and there are years when we don\'t even manage to give away the entire Costco bag. Thankfully, as mentioned earlier, I live with a gang of vultures who are more than happy to make that excess chocolate disappear. But you may not want to spend extra money when you really don\'t have to. Adopt a ""use it or don\'t buy it"" strategy with Costco No matter what grocery item I\'m thinking of buying in bulk at Costco, I implement one simple rule: Use it up, or don\'t buy it. Now sure, you could argue that in many cases, I\'m better off buying a bulk item from Costco, using 70% of it, and just throwing the remaining 30% away because that\'ll still be cheaper than a smaller quantity at a regular supermarket. But I happen to be someone who gets bothered by food waste, so I prefer not to go that route. Meanwhile, I can admit that I enjoy Halloween candy just as much as my kids (maybe more), so I never feel like I\'m taking a big risk in buying a bulk assortment of it. Worst case, we\'ll just have junk to snack on for months on end, since mass-produced candy doesn\'t go bad very quickly. But it does pay to be honest with yourself in the context of Halloween candy and any other bulk grocery item you may be tempted to scoop up at Costco. If you don\'t think you\'ll use it up, you may want to just pass.', 'url': 'https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/personal-finance/articles/should-you-buy-your-halloween-candy-at-costco/', 'publish_time': '2023-09-12 00:00:00'}, {'related_code': ['COST.O'], 'title': 'Costco (COST) Flat As Market Sinks: What You Should Know', 'content': ""In the latest trading session, Costco (COST) closed at $558.79, marking no change from the previous day.

Title: Texas Will No Longer Tax Menstrual Products and Some Family Care Products
Content: Many or all of the products here are from our partners that compensate us. It’s how we make money. But our editorial integrity ensures our experts’ opinions aren’t influenced by compensation. Terms may apply to offers listed on this page. Texas recently eliminated sales tax on period products and some family care products. By no longer having to pay sales tax on necessary items like tampons, pads, diapers, and baby bottles, Texas residents can keep more money in their pockets. Check out our pick for Best No Annual Fee Credit Card of 2023 A recent law that could save many Texans a significant amount of money went into effect. As of Sept. 1, menstrual and baby care products will no longer be taxed. Shoppers were previously charged a 6.25% sales tax when buying these items. But a state tax-relief bill that passed earlier this year has now made eligible purchases tax free. The tampon tax is no more in Texas Texas joins 23 other U.S. states and the District of Columbia in eliminating sales tax on menstrual products. Before a recent state law was signed into law, such products were classified as optional -- despite being very much a necessity for many people statewide. But since Sept. 1, these products are considered essential and are tax free. Products such as tampons, menstrual cups, and menstrual pads will no longer be taxed. This news is a significant win for the bank accounts of Texans. Over time, the savings will add up. In addition, some family care items will no longer be taxed. Diapers are one typical expense parents pay for that was taxed until recently. But as of Sept. 1, they're no longer taxed. Other eligible tax-free family care items include baby wipes, baby bottles, breast milk pumps, and maternity clothing. Preparing for and caring for young children can be extremely expensive, so this is welcome news for parents of babies and those currently expecting. According to research from the Texas Diaper Bank, an organization that supplies diapers to families in need, it costs $125 per month to diaper a baby. That's $1,500 a year to diaper one child. Considering the annual cost of diapers for one child, Texas parents will now save $93.75 per year by no longer having to pay tax on this necessary purchase. Hopefully, more states will implement tax-saving changes like this. Imposing taxes on necessary products like diapers and pads makes every day more costly for the average person. By making items like this tax free, Americans can feel some relief at the checkout aisle and may be less likely to go without the personal care products they need. Four ways to save money when buying everyday essentials Whether buying tampons, diapers, toilet paper, milk, or bread, you may be looking for ways to keep more money in your pocket. By being strategic when you shop, you can save some money and earn rewards. Here are a few tips: Shop sale items and compare prices. Before making your weekly shopping list, review local retailers' sales fliers. You can keep your spending to a minimum by purchasing store-brand items and sale items. It's also a good idea to compare prices from other nearby stores to get the best deal. Become a warehouse club member. By joining a warehouse club like Costco, you could save money by purchasing items in bulk. You'll get a deal and be stocked up for a while, which could help you save time by minimizing trips to the store. Use cash back apps. You can earn cash back when you shop by using one of the best cash back apps. These apps reward you for making eligible purchases. While you won't get an immediate discount on your shopping bill, you can later cash out your earnings. Use rewards credit cards. When you use rewards credit cards, you can earn points, miles, or cash back. You'll accumulate rewards as you spend money with your credit cards, and you can later redeem your rewards to pay yourself back for everyday purchases.

Title: Should You Buy Your Halloween Candy at Costco?
Content: Many or all of the products here are from our partners that compensate us. It’s how we make money. But our editorial integrity ensures our experts’ opinions aren’t influenced by compensation. Terms may apply to offers listed on this page. KEY POINTS It makes sense to buy Halloween candy in bulk if you tend to give out a lot of it. Costco has competitive prices, but if you only get a few trick-or-treaters, you might end up wasting money on a bulk bag or getting stuck with more sugar than you want. Check out our pick for Best No Annual Fee Credit Card of 2023 The other day, I was buying groceries at Costco when I spotted giant bags of Halloween candy on display. At first, I was somewhat horrified given that it was still early September and my kids hadn't even started school yet. But then I remembered that the Pumpkin Spice Latte was already back at Starbucks despite it being 90 degrees out. So clearly, the marketing people who make these decisions no longer care about waiting until the appropriate season to peddle their wares. Now, I didn't pick up any Halloween candy on this particular Costco trip for one big reason. If I bring home a giant sack of assorted goodies, my kids will ransack that stash in short order. So I'd rather wait until closer to Halloween to stock up on candy. Still, when I'm ready to buy my Halloween candy, Costco will most likely be my go-to source. Whether the same should hold true for you, however, depends on your situation. Why Costco may not be your best bet Let's get one thing out of the way. Any time you buy grocery items in bulk, you're likely to save money on a per-ounce or per-unit basis, regardless of what you're purchasing. Candy is no exception. As such, I'm not going to compare the cost of a Costco-sized bag of candy to a smaller bag with 12 pieces. There's just no comparison. A 90-ounce bag of mixed chocolate miniatures that include M&Ms;, Twix, and Reese's will cost you $22.99 at Costco if you buy it online. That's just $0.26 per ounce of candy. And you might spend even less if you buy it in-store. Meanwhile, a five-pound variety pack of chocolates that includes some of the same ones in the Costco assortment will cost you $45.95 on Amazon. That's $0.57 per ounce. So from a bulk pricing perspective, Costco is the clear winner (though to be fair, Amazon has many candy assortments on offer, so if you dig around the site long enough, you might find a better deal there). But while Costco's price for bulk candy is clearly competitive, the reality is that you probably don't want to buy your Halloween candy there unless you're absolutely certain you're going to need a lot of it. If your neighborhood is filled with children and you tend to get a lot of people knocking on your door asking for candy, then sure, spring for a bulk bag from Costco. But if you tend to get just a handful of trick-or-treaters, then you're probably better off getting your Halloween candy from a regular supermarket. Even if you end up spending four times as much on a per-ounce basis for candy, you're better off running up a $6 credit card tab if you don't eat a lot of candy or simply don't want a lot of it sitting in your kitchen, and you don't expect to have enough trick-or-treaters to use up a bulk bag. Heck, my neighborhood gets tons of trick-or-treaters, and there are years when we don't even manage to give away the entire Costco bag. Thankfully, as mentioned earlier, I live with a gang of vultures who are more than happy to make that excess chocolate disappear. But you may not want to spend extra money when you really don't have to. Adopt a ""use it or don't buy it"" strategy with Costco No matter what grocery item I'm thinking of buying in bulk at Costco, I implement one simple rule: Use it up, or don't buy it. Now sure, you could argue that in many cases, I'm better off buying a bulk item from Costco, using 70% of it, and just throwing the remaining 30% away because that'll still be cheaper than a smaller quantity at a regular supermarket. But I happen to be someone who gets bothered by food waste, so I prefer not to go that route. Meanwhile, I can admit that I enjoy Halloween candy just as much as my kids (maybe more), so I never feel like I'm taking a big risk in buying a bulk assortment of it. Worst case, we'll just have junk to snack on for months on end, since mass-produced candy doesn't go bad very quickly. But it does pay to be honest with yourself in the context of Halloween candy and any other bulk grocery item you may be tempted to scoop up at Costco. If you don't think you'll use it up, you may want to just pass.

Despite these fluctuations, the company maintains an Earnings Per Share (EPS) of 5.21. Investors and market spectators alike are keen to understand: is Alphabet (GOOGL) currently fairly valued? The following analysis delves into Alphabet's valuation, providing insights into whether the current stock price reflects the company's true worth. Company Introduction Alphabet Inc (GOOGL, Financial), the parent company of the internet media giant Google, stands as a beacon in the tech industry. With Google accounting for 99% of Alphabet's revenue—predominantly from online ads—its financial performance is critical to Alphabet's overall success. Other revenue streams include Google Play and YouTube sales, cloud service fees, and hardware such as the Pixel smartphone. Alphabet also invests in innovative 'moonshot' projects through its other bets segment, focusing on advancements in health, internet access, autonomous vehicles, and more. Currently, Alphabet's stock price is $132.45, with a market cap of $1.60 trillion, and the GF Value estimates its fair value at $143.34, denoting a stock that is fairly valued. Summarize GF Value The GF Value is a unique measure of intrinsic value, considering historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor for past performance and growth, and estimates of future business performance. This GF Value Line represents the ideal fair trading value for a stock. When a stock's price significantly exceeds this line, it may be overvalued and poised for lower future returns. Conversely, if the price is well below the GF Value Line, it could indicate an undervalued stock with higher future returns. Alphabet (GOOGL, Financial), with its current price of $132.45, aligns closely with the GF Value, suggesting a fair valuation. As Alphabet is fairly valued, its long-term stock return is likely to mirror the company's business growth rate. Link: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk. Financial Strength Investors must weigh a company's financial strength to avoid potential capital loss. Alphabet's cash-to-debt ratio of 4.13, although not leading the industry, still reflects a solid financial standing. With a financial strength rating of 9 out of 10, Alphabet's balance sheet is robust, boding well for its investment potential. Profitability and Growth Consistent profitability is a hallmark of a less risky investment. Alphabet has shown profitability for the past decade, with a notable operating margin of 26.51%, outperforming 84.89% of its peers. This excellent profitability score, coupled with a revenue of $297.10 billion over the past twelve months, underscores Alphabet's strong financial health. Moreover, growth is a crucial valuation metric. Alphabet's 3-year average annual revenue growth rate of 22.9% surpasses 72.5% of the companies in the Interactive Media industry, highlighting its value creation for shareholders. Its EBITDA growth rate also stands strong, further cementing Alphabet's growth prospects. ROIC vs WACC Evaluating a company's profitability involves comparing its Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) to its Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC). Alphabet's ROIC over the past 12 months is an impressive 28.57, significantly higher than its WACC of 11.07, indicating efficient value creation for shareholders. Conclusion Alphabet (GOOGL, Financial) presents itself as a fairly valued investment opportunity with strong financial health and impressive profitability. Its growth rate, better than two-thirds of its industry peers, further enhances its attractiveness.

South Korea is one of the few countries with its own foundational artificial intelligence models. Tech giant Naver is also one of the only global firms with a dominant local search engine to compete with Alphabet\'s GOOGL.O Google. ""The U.S. and China hold technological hegemony... They set the standards, which often means their technologies are a difficult fit for situations in countries around them, like regulations, users, companies,"" providing a competitive edge for Korean firms, Naver Cloud CEO Kim Yuwon told Reuters. The company declined to give export figures, but in October Naver affiliates won a $100 million export contract to provide digital twin mapping services to Saudi Arabia\'s Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs. More regional projects are expected in the future, Kim said. Kim said the company was in advanced talks with entities in the United Arab Emirates, the Philippines and Singapore. Such countries are eager to adopt AI, and ""have demands to create an ecosystem within them, rather than buying it from the U.S. or China unilaterally"", Kim said. Naver\'s unit Naver Cloud provides AI services, cloud computing, corporate services such as co-working tools, and designs and operates data centres. It opened the country\'s largest data centre last month, a facility that can accommodate up to 600,000 servers. With other units providing working in areas such as robotics, overseas clients could get a suite of services, Kim said. ""When you\'re not choosing a U.S. \'global standard\' service, there are concerns that what you\'re buying may not be compatible with the next technology... not so with Naver,"" he added.

When it comes to Uber, analysts have been right on the money. As it stands today, they\'re still incredibly upbeat, with all analysts sticking with their Buy ratings (more on this later) despite the past year\'s euphoric surge. Uber: Well-Positioned for the Age of Autonomy and AI Uber is an underestimated tech titan that has the network effects, data, and management to keep its run going strong into the new year. Although the firm received a bit of flack for its use of generative AI for images on its Uber Eats platform (some of them didn\'t seem all too appetizing), I think Uber is on the right track when it comes to AI. Looking ahead, Uber is poised to roll out a new AI assistant to help its Uber Eats customers find better deals and better-tailored options. Further, the biggest AI innovation to hit the roads (self-driving vehicles) could be the boon that takes the ride-hailing giant to even higher highs over the coming years. From ride-hailing to food delivery and even freight delivery, Uber has a lot to gain as it enters the self-driving age. Depending on your location, you can hail a Waymo autonomous vehicle from your Uber app. Alphabet\'s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Waymo and Uber certainly seem like a match made in heaven. Alphabet has the autonomous tech, while the Uber app is already in virtually everybody\'s pocket. Apart from Waymo, Uber is also looking to go driver-free with its Uber Freight business, recently teaming up with self-driving tech firm Waabi. It\'s a pretty big deal that bolsters Uber\'s cargo transporting capabilities. Undoubtedly, when many think of Uber, it\'s all about getting a ride or having food delivered, not so much about the freight business. Over the next few years, I\'d look for freight to contribute a more meaningful slice of the pie as it looks to expand its capabilities across all transportation fronts. Every Analyst is Bullish on UBER Stock On TipRanks, UBER stock comes in as a Strong Buy. Out of 34 analyst ratings, there are 34 unanimous Buy recommendations. The average UBER stock price target is $63.12, implying upside potential of 3.5%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $51.00 per share to a high of $75.00 per share. Though the average price target has compressed a bit, I think analysts will be inclined to hike their targets as they revisit their models with more consideration for the road ahead, which could entail a real boom in self-driving. In short, it doesn\'t appear to be a great time to take profits in one of the newest members of the S&P 500 (SPX) now that it\'s flirting with its all-time high of around $64 per share.

Sentiment uses short term technical analysis to gauge whether a stock is desired by investors. As a technical indicator, it focuses on recent trends as opposed to the long term health of the underlying company. Updates for the company such as a earnings release can move the stock away from current trends. Changes in price are generally the best indicator of sentiment for a particular stock. At its core, a stock's trend indicates whether current market sentiment is bullish or bearish. Investors must be bullish if a stock is trending upward, and are bearish if a stock is moving down. InvestorsObserver's Sentiment Indicator factors in both price changes and variations in volume. An increase in volume usually means a current trend is stengthening, while a drop in volume tends to signal a reversal to the ongoing trend. Our system also uses the options market in order to receive additional signals on current sentiments. We take into account the ratio of calls and puts for a stock since options allow an investor to bet on future changes in price. What's Happening With GOOGL Stock Today?

It's a major achievement because admission comes with strict criteria: The company must have a market capitalization more than $14.5 billion. The sum of its earnings over the past four quarters must be positive. Its earnings in the most recent quarter must be positive. At least 50% of the company's shares must be available for public trading. At least 250,000 of the company's shares must have traded hands in the last six months. But ticking all the boxes doesn't guarantee admission. The company must be selected by the U.S. Index Committee, which reviews the S&P 500 and its components periodically. It takes a few other things into account, including sector weighting -- the S&P 500 is a diversified index, so the committee wouldn't nominate 400 stocks from the technology sector alone, for example. Uber's management team has worked hard to swing the company into profitability while maintaining strong growth in its ride-hailing and food-delivery businesses. Below, I'll explain why its stock is a buy now and what joining the S&P 500 could mean for investors. Image source: Getty Images. Uber's mobility business has roared back to life Uber's operations are split into three segments: Mobility (ride-hailing), food delivery, and commercial freight. Mobility has always been the company's largest financial contributor, except during a brief period at the height of the pandemic when lockdowns and social restrictions were in effect. Food delivery took over during that challenging time, but mobility is now well and truly back. In the recent third quarter of 2023 (ended Sept. 30), customers booked $17.9 billion in rides, which was a 31% increase year over year. They also spent $16.1 billion on the Uber Eats food delivery platform, but that marked a much slower growth rate of 18%. Uber continues to innovate in the ride-hailing space. It recently launched Group Rides in 100 cities globally, which means friends traveling to the same destination can book one ride to pick them up, even if they are in different locations. The company also expanded its Taxi segment in New York City, so any customer who books an UberX can have the ride fulfilled by a yellow cab. Uber disrupted the traditional taxi industry when it burst onto the scene, and now it stands to profit from what's left. In the longer term, Uber is preparing for autonomous self-driving vehicles to enter the mobility industry at scale. It signed a number of partnerships with developers of the technology, including Alphabet's Waymo, which already offers autonomous rides through Uber in Phoenix, Arizona. Uber paid its human drivers $16 billion last quarter, so self-driving cars could eliminate that cost and transform the company's economics. Since Uber has 142 million monthly active customers on its platforms, it will be the go-to network for developers of autonomous vehicles who want to access the largest possible audience. Uber is finally profitable Losing money is often a feature of modern technology companies, not a bug. Investors encourage them to burn cash to drive growth, even if it means suffering steep losses at the bottom line. The idea is to acquire lots of customers fast and eventually cut costs down the road to turn the business profitable. Uber consistently lost money from its founding in 2009 up until the fourth quarter of 2022, when it delivered a net income (profit) of $595 million. It carried that momentum into 2023, recording a further $458 million in net income through the first nine months. The resurgence of its mobility business was a huge factor because it gave Uber more revenue to work with, but the company also carefully managed costs this year to shore up its bottom line. Through the first three quarters of 2023, Uber's operating expenses came in at $10.5 billion, which was $100 million less than the year-ago period. The largest reductions were in sales and marketing and administrative costs. However, the biggest tailwind for Uber's bottom line was the change in the value of its investments. The company owns an equity stake in at least five different start-ups, and their value plunged in 2022 amid the tech bear market. It dealt a $9.9 billion blow to Uber's financial results in the first nine months of that year, which swung to a $493 million profit in 2023. Those fluctuations in equity value merely happen on paper unless Uber sells, so they technically don't affect the company's financials. However, they must be included in its generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) results by law, which is the method the U.S. Index Committee relies upon to measure profitability. Joining the S&P 500 could boost Uber's stock Uber stock might have plenty of upside potential over the long term, but its inclusion in the S&P 500 might add some zest in the near term. In fact, its stock has already jumped 2.4% since the announcement on Friday. Why? Because every index fund that tracks the performance of the S&P 500 will be forced to buy Uber stock. Wall Street firm Bernstein estimates those funds will have to acquire around 200 million Uber shares, worth about $11.7 billion at the current price of $58.63. That translates to almost 10% of Uber's market value! While that will drive short-term demand for Uber stock, there is no guarantee that S&P 500 inclusion will lead to a higher valuation in the long term. Investors should remain focused on Uber's long-term potential as a business, and they should pay especially close attention to autonomous self-driving technologies, which could be a major value creator in the coming years. 10 stocks we like better than Uber Technologies When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Don’t Buy GOOG Stock Until 2024.', 'content': 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Google and YouTube parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) delivered outstanding value to its shareholders this year. GOOG stock provided exposure to the artificial intelligence (AI) technology market and rallied sharply. However, there’s no need to be greedy in December, so just hold your current Alphabet shares for a while. Remember, just because Alphabet is a member of the “Magnificent Seven” club, doesn’t mean the company is problem-free. It’s perfectly fine to hold Alphabet stock for the long term, but don’t be too eager to buy shares now. Remember, knowing when not to add to your stock position is just as important as knowing when to buy stocks. Did GOOG Stock Get Ahead of Itself? Even though the year isn’t finished yet, it’s easy to see why Alphabet has been a “Magnificent Seven” technology company in 2023. GOOG stock started off the year at around $90 but entered December above $130. Recently, Alphabet actually had a GAAP trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 25.44x. This is substantially higher than the sector median P/E ratio of 17.28x. Traditional valuation metrics aren’t the be-all and end-all, mind you. Yet, the company’s relatively high valuation suggests that there’s no urgent need to load up on Alphabet stock right now. Keep in mind that Alphabet has issues to deal with, not just in the U.S. but also in other countries. For example, the company is going to pay a whopping $100 million CAD, or around $73.6 million, every year to Canadian news publishers just to keep Google’s news stories in Canadian search results. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau praised the agreement, saying, “Google has agreed to properly support journalists, including local journalism.” This may be true, but it’s another example of how Alphabet has to spend money to put out legal fires in multiple regions of the world. An Issue That Could Weigh on Alphabet Stock Meanwhile, Alphabet continues to deal with legal/regulatory battles in its home country. Throughout 2023, some eager GOOG stock investors have conveniently ignored an ongoing anti-monopoly trial involving Google. This is an issue that could easily continue into the second half of 2024. The U.S. Justice Department’s legal case against Google could take a major financial toll on Alphabet. After all, it’s not cheap or easy to fight a legal battle against the U.S. government. The closing arguments for this antitrust case are reportedly set for May of next year. To be honest, Google has a seemingly unbreakable monopoly over the U.S. search market. Reportedly, Google’s share of this market has stayed between 83% and 91% since 2015. I recommend waiting a few months at least, especially if you’re thinking about loading the boat on Alphabet stock today. Just imagine the financial fallout if Alphabet has to break up Google because it’s too powerful in the search engine market. In that case, Alphabet’s valuation and market capitalization could deflate like a popped balloon. GOOG Stock: Know When to Buy and When to Wait Alphabet had a truly “magnificent” 2023. If you already own a moderately sized position in Alphabet stock, it’s fine to hold on to your shares. Alternatively, you might choose to take some profits, since Alphabet’s valuation is fairly rich now and Google is vulnerable to legal issues. Wait at least a few months for further updates on Google’s regulatory battles if you’re considering taking a large stake in GOOG stock.

Wage growth and unemployment rates play a pivotal role in shaping the Fed’s policy decisions. The market’s direction hinges on the outcomes of the Payrolls report and the Fed’s response. Overview In the financial markets, anticipation is building around the upcoming U.S. Non-Farm Payrolls report, a critical determinant of economic health and potential Federal Reserve actions. With the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 futures showing minimal changes, investors are maintaining a cautious stance as they await the job report’s release. Key Expectations from the Job Report Economists anticipate the addition of 190,000 jobs in November, a notable uptick from October’s 150,000. This increase, if realized, suggests a resilient labor market, contradicting expectations of an economic slowdown. However, a robust jobs report could potentially complicate the Federal Reserve’s rate hike strategy, as it seeks to balance inflation control with economic growth. Wage Growth and Unemployment: Key Factors The job report’s impact extends beyond the total number of jobs added. Wage growth and the unemployment rate are also pivotal. Expected wage growth of 0.3% month-over-month and 4% year-over-year could influence the Fed’s inflation outlook. The unemployment rate, currently at 3.9%, will be closely examined for signs of economic strength or weakness. Market Implications and Trader Sentiment A significantly positive or disappointing jobs report could lead to market reevaluations of the Fed’s interest rate trajectory. Investors are currently leaning towards a less aggressive Fed stance by the second quarter of 2024. This week’s data, including lower-than-expected jobless claims and private payroll additions, has painted a picture of a softening yet resilient job market. Tech Sector’s Performance The Nasdaq Composite, buoyed by strong performances from tech giants like Alphabet and AMD, is on track for a sixth consecutive winning week, contrasting with the less optimistic S&P 500 and Dow Jones. Anticipating the Payrolls Report The Non-Farm Payrolls report is not just about the number of jobs added; it’s a comprehensive snapshot of the labor market’s health. Metrics like wage growth and unemployment rate provide deeper insights into economic trends and guide the Federal Reserve’s policy decisions. The stock market’s direction in the coming days will heavily depend on the outcomes of the U.S. Non-Farm Payrolls report and subsequent Federal Reserve actions. A positive jobs report, indicating robust economic health, could bolster investor confidence but might also signal continued aggressive rate hikes by the Fed. Conversely, a weaker-than-expected jobs report could fuel expectations of a more dovish Fed stance, potentially soothing market volatility but raising concerns about economic slowing. Technical Analysis Daily E-mini Nasdaq-100 Index Analyzing the E-mini Nasdaq-100 Index using the provided technical indicators, the current daily price of 16228.00 shows a positive momentum as it is higher than the previous close of 16038.75. This uptick suggests short-term buying interest. When compared to the 200-day moving average (14532.01) and 50-day moving average (15344.42), the current price is well above both, indicating a strong bullish trend in the medium to long term. The price is also above the main support level (15717.75), reinforcing the bullish sentiment. However, as it hovers around the minor support level (16203.25), which now acts as a pivot, the market may be cautious, observing if it can sustain this level to continue the upward trajectory. Overall, the market sentiment appears bullish, but watchfulness is advised near the pivotal minor support level for any signs of reversal.

Google\'s new Gemini AI model generated mixed reactions following its recent debut. Over a million viewers watched a video demonstrating Gemini\'s capabilities before disclosing the essential fabrication of the most remarkable aspect of the demo, TechCrunch reports. The video, titled ""Hands-on with Gemini: Interacting with multimodal AI,"" demonstrated how Gemini, a multimodal model that combines language and visual understanding, could respond flexibly to various inputs. It showcased tasks like evolving a sketch of a duck, tracking objects in a cup-switching game, recognizing shadow puppet gestures, and more. However, the video didn\'t accurately represent the model\'s capabilities. In reality, the company created the interactions in the video using carefully tuned text prompts with still images rather than live demonstrations of Gemini\'s abilities, raising questions about the accuracy and integrity of Google\'s presentation. While Gemini generated responses similar to those shown in the video, how they were portrayed differed significantly from the actual user experience. Google\'s attempt to inspire developers with a stylized representation of interactions led to confusion and mistrust among viewers. The incident has raised concerns about Google\'s transparency and trustworthiness in showcasing its AI models. On Thursday, Google integrated Gemini AI, its most advanced AI model, into Google\'s chatbot Bard.

Two reliable growth stocks, Alphabet (GOOGL 0.04%) (GOOG 0.25%) and Microsoft (MSFT -0.00%), saw price dips, along with many other strong stocks last year but have surged in 2023. These companies have potent positions in tech and will likely continue rewarding patient investors with significant gains in the new year. Here's why these two growth stocks are at the top of my list as we head into 2024. 1. Alphabet Alphabet has enjoyed immense growth over the years, with its stock up 141% since 2018 and annual revenue rising over 100%. The company's majority market share in search engines has given it the funds and brand recognition to expand to several lucrative markets, which will likely keep Alphabet expanding in 2024 and beyond. Brands like Google, Android, and YouTube have garnered billions of users and present almost endless advertising opportunities. As a result, Alphabet has become an advertising powerhouse, significantly profiting from the $680 billion digital advertising industry. In the third quarter of 2023, Alphabet's revenue rose 11% year over year, beating Wall Street forecasts by $980 million. The company benefited from a return to growth in the digital ad market, which suffered from macroeconomic headwinds the previous year. Google Search sales increased by 11%, with YouTube ads up 12%. Additionally, Alphabet is an exciting option for anyone investing in AI before 2024. The tech giant will launch a highly anticipated large language model it calls Gemini, which is expected to be competitive with OpenAI's top-shelf AI engine, GPT-4. The model could boost multiple areas of Alphabet's business and see it gain a powerful position in the industry. Data by YCharts. Moreover, Alphabet looks like a bargain heading into the new year. The tables above show the company's price-to-free-cash-flow and price-to-sales ratios have decreased significantly over the last three years. This means Alphabet is trading at one of its cheapest levels in years. Alongside an attractive forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 22, Alphabet is an exciting growth stock for 2024. 2. Microsoft This steady growth stock is up in value by roughly 238% in the last five years, with annual revenue climbing 106%. The company's growth is due primarily to operating business segments with considerable market share in multiple growing industries. With megapopular brands such as Windows, Office, Xbox, Azure, and LinkedIn, Microsoft has what it takes to continue expanding its businesses in 2024 and beyond. Grand View Research projects the $484 billion cloud market will generate a compound annual growth rate of 14% until at least 2030. Meanwhile, Microsoft's cloud platform Azure holds a 22% market share in the industry, second only to Amazon Web Services. Microsoft's intelligent cloud segment has been the fastest-growing part of its business in recent years. In Q1 of fiscal 2024, the segment's revenue increased 19% year over year, while operating income rose 31%. Microsoft is already significantly benefiting from the market's growth and plans to expand further in the industry with heavy investment in AI. Demand for AI cloud services has skyrocketed this year. Microsoft responded by increasing its investment in ChatGPT developer OpenAI, achieving a 49% stake in the start-up. The company is integrating OpenAI's tech across its product lineup as it strives to become the go-to for anyone seeking ways to boost productivity through AI. Data by YCharts. In addition to a long growth history, Microsoft is one of the cheapest stocks in AI and the cloud market. As the charts above show, the company has a lower forward P/E and price-to-free cash-flow ratio than some of the biggest names in these industries, indicating its stock offers the most value. And with free cash flow of $63 billion as of Sept. 30, Microsoft is well equipped to continue investing in and expanding its many businesses in 2024."", 'url': 'https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/12/08/my-best-growth-stocks-for-2024/', 'publish_time': '2023-12-08 12:44:00'}, {'title': 'Google weighs Gemini AI project to tell people their life story using phone data, photos', 'content': '""Project Ellmann"" is an internal Google proposal to use AI to help users get a ""bird\'s-eye view"" of their life stories.

The team also demonstrated ""Ellmann Chat,"" with the description ""Imagine opening ChatGPT but it already knows everything about your life."" A team at Google has proposed using AI technology to create a ""bird\'s-eye"" view of users\' lives using mobile phone data such as photographs and searches. Dubbed ""Project Ellmann,"" after biographer and literary critic Richard David Ellmann, the idea would be to use LLMs like Gemini to ingest search results, spot patterns in a user\'s photos, create a chatbot, and ""answer previously impossible questions,"" according to a copy of a presentation viewed by CNBC. Ellmann\'s aim, it states, is to be ""Your Life Story Teller."" It\'s unclear if the company has plans to produce these capabilities within Google Photos, or any other product. Google Photos has more than one billion users and four trillion photos and videos, according to a company blog post. Project Ellman is just one of many ways Google is proposing to create or improve its products with AI technology. On Wednesday, Google launched its latest ""most capable"" and advanced AI model yet, Gemini, which in some cases outperformed OpenAI\'s GPT-4. The company is planning to license Gemini to a wide range of customers through Google Cloud for them to use in their own applications. One of Gemini\'s standout features is that it\'s multimodal, meaning it can process and understand information beyond text, including images, video and audio. A product manager for Google Photos presented Project Ellman alongside Gemini teams at a recent internal summit, according to documents viewed by CNBC. They wrote that the teams spent the past few months determining that large language models are the ideal tech to make this bird\'s-eye approach to one\'s life story a reality. Ellmann could pull in context using biographies, previous moments, and subsequent photos to describe a user\'s photos more deeply than ""just pixels with labels and metadata,"" the presentation states. It proposes to be able to identify a series of moments like university years, Bay Area years, and years as a parent. ""We can\'t answer tough questions or tell good stories without a bird\'s-eye view of your life,"" one description reads alongside a photo of a small boy playing with a dog in the dirt. ""We trawl through your photos, looking at their tags and locations to identify a meaningful moment,"" a presentation slide reads. ""When we step back and understand your life in its entirety, your overarching story becomes clear."" The presentation said large language models could infer moments like a user\'s child\'s birth. ""This LLM can use knowledge from higher in the tree to infer that this is Jack\'s birth, and that he\'s James and Gemma\'s first and only child."" ""One of the reasons that an LLM is so powerful for this bird\'s-eye approach, is that it\'s able to take unstructured context from all different elevations across this tree, and use it to improve how it understands other regions of the tree,"" a slide reads, alongside an illustration of a user\'s various life ""moments"" and ""chapters."" Presenters gave another example of determining one user had recently been to a class reunion. ""It\'s exactly 10 years since he graduated and is full of faces not seen in 10 years so it\'s probably a reunion,"" the team inferred in its presentation. The team also demonstrated ""Ellmann Chat,"" with the description: ""Imagine opening ChatGPT but it already knows everything about your life. What would you ask it?"" It displayed a sample chat in which a user asks ""Do I have a pet?"" To which it answers that yes, the user has a dog which wore a red raincoat, then offered the dog\'s name and the names of the two family members it\'s most often seen with. Another example for the chat was a user asking when their siblings last visited. Another asked it to list similar towns to where they live because they are thinking of moving. Ellmann offered answers to both. Ellmann also presented a summary of the user\'s eating habits, other slides showed. ""You seem to enjoy Italian food. There are several photos of pasta dishes, as well as a photo of a pizza."" It also said that the user seemed to enjoy new food because one of their photos had a menu with a dish it didn\'t recognize. The technology also determined what products the user was considering purchasing, their interests, work, and travel plans based on the user\'s screenshots, the presentation stated. It also suggested it would be able to know their favorite websites and apps, giving examples Google Docs, Reddit and Instagram. A Google spokesperson told CNBC, ""Google Photos has always used AI to help people search their photos and videos, and we\'re excited about the potential of LLMs to unlock even more helpful experiences. This is a brainstorming concept a team is at the early stages of exploring. As always, we\'ll take the time needed to ensure we do it responsibly, protecting users\' privacy as our top priority.""', 'publish_time': '2023-12-08 14:00:01', 'related_code': ['GOOG.O', 'GOOGL.O'], 'url': 'https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/08/google-weighing-project-ellmann-uses-gemini-ai-to-tell-life-stories.html'}, {'related_code': ['MSFT.O', 'GOOG.O', 'GOOGL.O'], 'title': ""Google Crushes Microsoft's AI Monopoly"", 'content': ""Justin Sullivan On December 7, 2023, Alphabet Inc. shares (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) gained 5.34%, dragging the rest of the market with them.

A six-minute promotional video meant to show how advanced the AI technology caught the attention of many people this week, following Google\'s launch of Gemini. The criticism comes as déjà vu for the company\'s demonstrations earlier this year, which employees called ""rushed, botched."" Google is facing scrutiny over its demonstration video for its newly launched AI model, Gemini. On Wednesday, just weeks before the year\'s end, Google launched what it considers its largest and most capable artificial intelligence model Gemini and presented a demonstrative video to media outlets and the public. The six-minute video includes spoken conversations between the user and a Gemini-powered chatbot, and also shows Gemini\'s ability to recognize visual pictures and physical objects and know the difference. Some of the capabilities were impressive, such as Gemini\'s ability to voice aloud a description of drawings of a duck, and describing a drawing of a duck versus a rubber duck, among other examples. The company\'s description on YouTube includes a short line ""For the purposes of this demo, latency has been reduced, and Gemini outputs have been shortened for brevity."" However, it doesn\'t make that disclaimer in the video itself. Following the launch, the company later confirmed to Bloomberg the demo wasn\'t conducted in real time, but instead used still images and fed text prompts that Gemini responded to, as previously pointed out by The Information. The author noted that was ""quite different"" from what Google seemed to to be suggesting: ""that a person could have a smooth voice conversation with Gemini as it watched and responded in real-time to the world around it."" After multiple requests for comment, the company on Friday told CNBC, ""The video is an illustrative depiction of the possibilities of interacting with Gemini, based on real multimodal prompts and outputs from testing,"" a spokesperson said in a statement. ""We look forward to seeing what people create when access to Gemini Pro opens on December 13."" Though demos are often edited, the subsequent findings of Gemini bring up déjà vu for the search giant. Google faced criticism from the public and Wall Street earlier in the year for what its own employees called a ""rushed, botched"" demonstration of its AI chatbots, which happened the same week Microsoft planned on showcasing its Bing integration with ChatGPT. Earlier this month, The Information reported that Google scrapped plans for a set of in-person events to launch Gemini, eventually settling on a virtual launch.

Buying a last-minute business class ticket could break your budget. But that doesn\'t mean you can\'t find last-minute business class deals that fit your budget. Airfare search tools, in-app upgrade offers, and premium airfare deal services could help you land a last-minute business class ticket for a low price. Many travelers book economy class airfare because these tickets are the most affordable option. Having to pay the standard price for a business class ticket could result in an expensive credit card bill. But there are ways to book business class flights without draining your bank account. A business class deal can allow you to enjoy a more comfortable travel experience without going broke. Here are a few ways to score last-minute business class deals. Use an airfare search tool to find affordable business class flights I regularly use airfare search tools like Google Flights. Resources like this make it easier for me to get pricing information across multiple carriers and compare rates and flight offerings so I\'m more informed before booking a flight. You can also use tools like this to find airfare deals. One of my favorite ways to use Google Flights is to go into my search with no destination in mind. I enter my departing airport and search ""Anywhere"" for my arrival destination. By doing this, I can find the most affordable destinations to travel to based on my preferred dates. Google Flights allows you to search by ticket type, including business class. The results will be displayed with prices for each destination around the globe. This tool could help you find cheaper business class flights for your last-minute travel needs. Plus, it could encourage you to visit a destination that wasn\'t originally on your radar. Pay to upgrade an existing flight at the last moment Another way to find last-minute business class deals is to take advantage of seat upgrade offers on flights you\'ve already booked. Have a flight coming up within the next two to three weeks? Download your airline\'s mobile app and review the in-app upgrade offers daily. You may be able to upgrade your existing ticket to a business class seat for a reasonable price. Let\'s imagine you paid $1,000 roundtrip to fly on an economy class ticket to Paris. What if you could score a one-way upgrade for $600? It may be worthwhile to upgrade your seat, and it would be a lot cheaper than paying for a business class ticket outright. Featured offer: save money while you pay off debt with one of these top-rated balance transfer credit cards Here\'s something to consider before you upgrade your ticket: If you originally booked a roundtrip ticket, the upgrade offer usually only applies to a portion of your trip. So you\'d be paying to upgrade one way, not the entire trip. Consider this when deciding if the cost is worth it. Upgrade costs can and do change, so it pays to check back. The price could be $1,800 one day and $950 the next. So don\'t give up hope if the prices you see are high. But always review your personal finances before upgrading. Don\'t be tempted to overspend beyond your means. Subscribe to an airfare deal service Travel is a big passion of mine, but that doesn\'t mean I want to spend a lot of money on airfare. For this reason, I\'ve continued to subscribe to flight deal services. With these subscriptions, you receive email alerts for flight deals. You can continue prioritizing your love of travel but keep your spending in check by using flight deal services. One of the services I\'m currently using sends business class flight deals. Some flight deals are for dates well in advance, but I\'ve also seen deals advertised for travel dates that are soon approaching, like within the next few weeks or a month or two. If you have a flexible schedule and love a good deal, services like this could help you land last-minute business class tickets. Inexpensive business class tickets exist Yes, flying in business class can be extremely costly. For a long-haul international flight, it\'s not unusual to pay several thousand dollars. That\'s a lot of money to spend for added comfort. But there are opportunities to score business class flight deals. Now that you know some of my favorite hacks, you\'ll be better prepared to seek out cheaper premium flight tickets. When paying for airfare, whether you\'re flying economy or business class, consider using a travel credit card. You could earn rewards on your spending and redeem them for travel.

Futures down: Dow 0.22%, S&amp;P 0.23%, Nasdaq 0.32% Aug 18 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures edged lower on Friday after a three-day selloff on Wall Street, as evidence of a resilient U.S. economy spurred fears that the Federal Reserve would hold interest rates for longer than previously expected. Wall Street&#039;s main indexes have shed over 2% each this week after a spate of strong economic data, including a fall in weekly jobless claims, caused investors to dial back expectations of rate cuts and drove up government bond yields. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note US10YT=RR hit a ten-month high of 4.328% in the previous session and came within a whisker of its highest level since 2007. US/ ""The relative strength of the U.S. economy is prompting fears of rates sticking higher for longer across the Atlantic and a potential shift from the current easing of inflationary pressures. This is reflected in a big surge in U.S. government bond yields,"" said Russ Mould, AJ Bell investment director. On Friday, big technology and growth stocks slipped in premarket trade even as Treasury yields eased, with Tesla TSLA.O down 1.7% and leading declines. Risk sentiment has also been hurt in recent days by China&#039;s sluggish economic recovery and growing concerns about its property market. U.S.-listed shares of Chinese companies JD.Com JD.O and Alibaba Group BABA.N fell 3.6% and 2.4% respectively. Among major movers of the day, Applied Materials AMAT.O rose 3.2% after the chip equipment maker forecast fourth-quarter profit above analysts&#039; estimates and posted better-than-expected third-quarter earnings. Estee Lauder EL.N and Deere &amp; Co DE.N are among companies scheduled to report quarterly earnings before the bell. With no major economic data due on Friday, focus will now shift to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell&#039;s speech at the Jackson Hole economic symposium next week. Earnings from chip designer Nvidia NVDA.O, which have rallied this year on enthusiasm around artificial intelligence, will also grab the spotlight in the coming days. At 5:27 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis 1YMcv1 were down 76 points, or 0.22%, S&amp;P 500 e-minis EScv1 were down 10.25 points, or 0.23%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis NQcv1 were down 47 points, or 0.32%. Shares of Keysight Technologies KEYS.N dropped 11.2% on the electronic equipment maker&#039;s downbeat fourth-quarter forecast.

Now, let me turn the call over to our CEO, Ms. Sandy Xu.</p> <p>Sandy Xu: Thanks, Sean. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us today to discuss our Q2 results. Q2 was a productive quarter for JD. We delivered a solid performance with both top-line and bottom-line results exceeding our expectations. More importantly, during the quarter, we effectively executed our business and organizational development, further improved our supply chain capabilities and achieved many operational and financial milestones while navigating a challenging industry environment. We are encouraged by the progress we are making on these priorities, and I want to share some of the details with you. Let me start by reiterating JD&#039;s operating philosophy since our inception, which is to relentlessly strive for lower cost, higher efficiency and superior customer experience.</p> <div> Story continues </div> <p>This is at the heart of everything we do and it primarily consists of two critical elements, namely customer experience and supply chain capabilities. First, on customer experience, we always focus on providing best-in-class customer experience and continue to find ways to improve selection, speed, quality and value, in Chinese, [Foreign Language]. Particularly since the beginning of this year, we have gone extra miles to improve our selection and value, while our quality and speed continue to lead the industry. On selection, we are taking solid steps to improve our platform ecosystem, which in JD&#039;s case means the prosperous coexistence of both our 1P and third-party marketplace businesses. Our platform ecosystem strategy is guided by our goal to continuously improve customer experience, and both 1P and 3P models are means to this end.</p> <p>It was an exciting quarter for our third-party marketplace business. We feel that we are only at the early stage of realizing JD&#039;s marketplace business potential, but we were encouraged to see the number of 3P merchants more than double year-on-year and set an all-time record in Q2, as we improve our tools and traffic allocation mechanism to build [indiscernible] and effective operating environment. With the improving operating environment, more 3P merchants brought a broad selection of products to our customers, driving 3P marketplace GMV growth to accelerate over the last two consecutive quarters. Moreover, we have seen two consecutive quarters of double-digit 3P revenue growth, mainly driven by robust growth of advertising revenues as more 3P merchants allocated ad budget to JD&#039;s platform.</p> <div> <div></div> </div> <p>On value, since the beginning of the year, we have launched new initiatives to enhance our reputation for providing value to users. Sometimes I hear people make the argument that JD&#039;s pursuit of low prices will inevitably impact user experience and our profitability. We know this argument is incorrect. Value means providing both low price and extra value or services for the many customers pay. And not surprisingly JD&#039;s supply chain capability is the key to delivering this. With lower cost and higher efficiency generated through our supply chain, we are able to provide more value and extra service to our customers. Take our RMB10 billion discount program as an example, as we continue to enrich its value for many selection of 3P merchandises, which is resonating with our customers.</p> <p>3P GMV contribution with this program has gradually increased to over 50% in July. Also, with this program moving ahead, we were still able to maintain a healthy bottom-line in Q2, which Ian will elaborate shortly. This is a strong proof of how we leveraged our supply chain and managed our business effectively to serve our users better. Another proof is that our core categories, including PC and home appliances, continued to benefit from our robust supply chain capabilities, which enable us to provide steady supply at low prices and high-quality services at the same time. As a result, we further gained market share in these core categories in the quarter. During the quarter, we observed strong user engagement trends, including higher purchase frequency and ARPU on our app.</p> <p>In particular, the number of repeat customers continued to grow by double digits, while the average GMV per user increased by high-single digits. The number of JD Plus members continued to grow over 20% year-over-year and reached 36 million in Q2. All these are strong testaments, that on top of our speed and quality. User recognition of our improved selection and value gets stronger as our supply chain capabilities continue to serve as the bedrock of our resilient business performance. In the last two quarters this year, we have been [focused on] (ph) executing our strategic priorities, including our platform ecosystem and enhancing our customer experience with superior selection to speed, quality and value. As we have talked a lot about our business development today, now I&#039;d like to share some color on the progress of our organizational restructuring.</p> <p>We launched this initiative in Q2, in which we focused to flatten our management structure and delegate greater decision-making power to the operational units that are closer to users. Our goal is to improve organizational efficiency and incentivize entrepreneurship even at the frontline level. So far, the restructuring is progressing as expected. We&#039;ve completed reassigning responsibilities and [citing] (ph) KPIs for each of the operational units and are now in the process of tracking and assessing execution as well as further streamlining the [nodes] (ph) in operation and iterating our business supporting systems. The restructuring involves a lot of efforts, and it takes time to bring its effectiveness into full play. But we&#039;ve seen that, under the new structure, our operational units are more incentivized and showcase enhanced professionalism and executive capabilities.</p>  <div> <div> <div> <p id=""p_f76dec427cc514a1336b37590891e8a0"" class=""img_p"" ><img src=""https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/IIlthxABee90ianiM4YTzw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTQxMQ--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/insidermonkey.com/68e40c9a3ca38c984c51ed5670673a6f"" id=""f76dec427cc514a1336b37590891e8a0"" onerror=""javascript: this.parentNode.style.display=\'none\'; "" /></p><p></p>  <p id=""p_f76dec427cc514a1336b37590891e8a0"" class=""img_p"" ><img src=""https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/IIlthxABee90ianiM4YTzw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTQxMQ--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/insidermonkey.com/68e40c9a3ca38c984c51ed5670673a6f"" id=""f76dec427cc514a1336b37590891e8a0"" onerror=""javascript: this.parentNode.style.display=\'none\'; "" /></p><p></p>  </div> </div> </div>  <p>Pixabay/Public domain</p> <p>It&#039;s really encouraging to see our decisions and efforts start to pay off and yield early positive results. As JD continues to execute these strategies, from a long-term perspective, we are more confident that than ever in our ability to deliver healthy and sustainable growth and continue to seize new opportunities to innovate and drive our business growth going forward. At our 20th anniversary this June 18th, we introduced our ambitious 35711 Vision. The vision includes our goals in the next 20 years of establishing three enterprises with over RMB1 trillion in revenues and RMB7 billion in net profit, having five JD subsidiaries rank on the Fortune Global 500 list and seven publicly-listed companies with over RMB100 billion market cap, while contributing RMB100 billion in taxes and creating over 1 million jobs as a group.</p> <p>This is a vision that outlines both a path for sustained growth for the next 20 years, and our commitment to positive social impact. It also highlights our unshakable confidence in, and commitment to, China&#039;s long-term economic development. As we look ahead to the second half of the year and the future, we are focused on the healthy growth of our business and investing in exciting new opportunities, driven by our unchanged long-term strategies that center around cost, efficiency and customer experience, and a deeper sense of mission. We believe we are well positioned to create long-term value for our users, business partners, shareholders, and the society at large. With that, I&#039;ll turn it over to Ian for our financial highlights. Thank you.</p> <p>Ian Shan: Thank you, Sandy. Hello, everyone. We&#039;re happy to report that JD delivered both revenues and profitability ahead of our expectation. We continue to execute our proactive business development and made solid progress across several of our priorities, including building a robust marketplace ecosystem, enhancing user mindshare on our value propositions of selection, speed, quality and value, and delivering healthy profitability. Such results validates our strategic focus, and we&#039;re confident in the underlying strength of our business momentum. With that, let&#039;s turn to our financial results in Q2. Our net revenues grew by 8% year-on-year to RMB288 billion in Q2. Breaking down the revenue mix. Product revenues were up 3% year-on-year in Q2.</p> <p>By category, electronics and home appliances revenues grew by a remarkable 11% year-on-year in Q2, mainly driven by the strong growth of home appliance and mobile phones, both of which have outpaced the industry growth during the quarter. Our further reinforced market leadership in these categories showed our strong user mindshare, robust supply chain capabilities and industry-leading service quality, which are all key differentiators for JD. General merchandise revenues were down 9% year-on-year in Q2, primarily due to the soft performance of our supermarket category, which was partially impacted by the relatively high base in the same period last year due to COVID. That said, I would like to reiterate our confidence in supermarket&#039;s future performance, as its operating efficiency has improved significantly with a healthier product mix.</p> <p>Service revenues grew by 30% year-on-year in Q2, of which marketplace and marketing revenues were up 9% year-on-year. I would like to highlight that revenues generated by third-party merchants grew faster than 1P in the quarter, driven by 3P advertising revenues. As we roll out more supportive measures for merchants, we saw notable acceleration in merchant base expansion in the quarter. It&#039;s also encouraging to see that our traffic conversion rate had a meaningful improvement that indicates our traffic allocation algorithm is driving co-development of our 1P and 3P business effectively. Turning back to our service revenues. Logistics and other service revenues grew by 52% year-on-year in Q2. Excluding impact from Deppon&#039;s consolidation, organic growth of logistics and other service revenues was 12% year-on-year.</p> <p>Now, let&#039;s turn to our segment performance. JD Retail revenues grew 5% year-on-year in the quarter as we continue to finetune our operations that focuses on improving efficiency and building core capabilities since Q4 last year. Regarding JD Retail&#039;s profitability, gross margin continued to expand year-on-year in Q2. Our proactive efforts have clearly driven higher operating efficiency of our supply chain, even as we took firm steps to address value on our platform. JD Retail&#039;s non-GAAP operating margin came in at 3.2%, slightly declined compared to Q2 last year, as we made proactive efforts to invest in user experience, which has already started to show in the improvement of our user engagement. The slight year-on-year operating margin decline was also partially due to an abnormally high margin in Q2 last year on the COVID impact.</p> <p>While, we aggressively cut back operating expenses, including marketing spending, we maintain our goal to drive sustainable growth and improve profitability of our core retail business in the long term. In terms of users, as we continue to expand supplies and address value on our platform, JD Retail saw a year-on-year increase in user shopping frequency and retention in Q2, which led to a higher average GMV per user in the quarter. This was also partially contributed by the expansion of our core user base. Overall, we&#039;re happy with strong user quality metrics, which is a result of our focus on user quality and user experience. JD Logistics saw a 31% revenue growth year-on-year in Q2. Excluding the impact of consolidation of the platform, the growth rate was 5%.</p> <p>Thanks to the resilient growth from external customers, in Q2, revenues from external customers reached 69% of JD Logistics revenue. In terms of profitability, JDL&#039;s non-GAAP operating margin was 1.2% in the quarter, a jump of 113 bps from a year ago, primarily driven by its optimized business structure and customer mix, and better economies of scale and business expansion. Dada reported revenue of RMB2.8 billion and non-GAAP operating loss of RMB29 million for the quarter, a substantial improvement compared to a year ago, primarily driven by better operating efficiency, and the economics of scale. Intracity on-demand retail business remains an important pillar in our strategic positioning, and we&#039;re encouraged to see that, Daojia and Shop Now have expanded to cooperate with 300,000 offline stores, and are providing on-demand retail services in more than 2,000 counties, districts, and cities.</p> <p>Revenues from new business come down to RMB4.3 billion in Q2, as we further scale back Jingxi and international business on a year-on-year basis, while JD Property maintained its robust growth momentum. New business saw a turnaround of profitability and recorded an operating profit of RMB1.1 billion, primarily due to the gain from the third core fund closing of JDP in Q2, as well as the narrowing losses from Jingxi and international business, both of which were minimal for the quarter. Moving to the consolidated bottom-line. We recorded RMB8.6 billion non-GAAP net income attributable to ordinary shareholders in Q2, up 32% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net margin reached 3%, up 55 bps from a year ago, which set a new record for our June promotion quarter.</p> <p>Finally, our last 12-month free cash flow as of June 30 was RMB33 billion, increased by 21% on a year-on-year basis. This was mainly driven by our improved profitability, which led to a higher operating cash flow, as well as further optimize cash conversion cycle. To conclude my remarks, as we continue to improve our operations, we saw multiple encouraging trends in Q2. We&#039;re confident that we&#039;ll emerge stronger with a healthy and sustainable business structure and enhanced core capabilities to unlock our group potential.

The Chinese inflation rate has fallen to negative numbers, or deflation, indicating that demand on both the business and consumer side has been lackluster at best. However, most people need to remember that these cycles are a natural occurrence, and the only way to go from here is up. JD.com (NASDAQ: JD) is positioned to benefit significantly from the PCB&#039;s (people&#039;s Bank of China) reaction to these slowing trends, as the decision to lower interest rates at the fastest pace in the last decade will create major consumption tailwinds. Investors will realize why JD.com is more recession-proof than perceived and why this name severely understates the upside. Little Downside, Lots of Upside The first stop in this value potential trip is the stock chart, where investors can begin to understand just how little downside there is today. Since the stock is trading at a price not seen since early 2020, which would also fall into a significant eight-year support level of $32 to $35 per share, fire sale valuations will likely limit any further selloffs or downside potential from today&#039;s prices. JD.com analyst ratings are beginning to notice the unbalance, which favors the upside by a significant gap. A consensus upside of 65% from today&#039;s prices is only the beginning regarding the route map investors can follow for a &#039;promise land&#039; investment. Another way to analyze the balance between upside and downside, more traditionally, is by comparing today&#039;s valuation multiples across comparable companies. Taking PDD (NASDAQ: PDD) as a comparison example, JD.com becomes even more attractive. Carrying a 15.0x forward price-to-earnings ratio, which values the next twelve months of earnings rather than the past twelve months, will make PDD 50% more expensive than JD.com&#039;s 10.0x multiple. Likewise, analysts see less upside potential in PDD, as ratings only suggest a 33% upside from today. The landscape is set for the stock, tailwinds from everywhere, and favorable valuations. Yet, the stock is down by 3.3% on Wednesday&#039;s trading session. Did bears find a justifiable pitfall within the company&#039;s earnings release? Fundamental Disconnect Within the company&#039;s earnings presentation, investors can begin to find some business logic to back up their consideration for a possible purchase. Remembering that the stock is trading at 2020 prices, comparing some key metrics between today and the past would be helpful. Starting with net income margins, 2020 operated under 2.3% margins, while today&#039;s quarter will improve toward 3.0%. The push comes from an 8% advance in net revenues over the past twelve months, despite the underlying economy - and consumer - being in a recession. Free cash flow (operating cash flow minus capital expenditures) was reported at 33.5 billion RMB, an increase of 21% over the past year. The double-digit growth in free cash flow should have gone in tandem with a similar advance in the stock price, yet there was nothing. Earnings per share finished the quarter at $0.59, compared to last year&#039;s $0.32. This jump of 84% should have - again - reflected a similar rise in the stock price since earnings typically drive stock valuations. There is a massive disconnect in logic here that a few brave value investors will be able to exploit. The stock&#039;s decline this week cannot be attributed to earnings results, as everything within the release suggests healthy growing operations. It would make sense to assume that the current sentiment towards China, especially the stagnant growth figures, drives money away from names like this one. Investors need to understand that the near-term timeline is filled with ticking value bombs, as the imminent effect of economic stimulus making its way down to the consumer level will bring JD.com into a new level of growth. China has the fastest-growing middle class, a ripe audience to boost volumes and earnings once confidence returns as a push for more consumer spending across this demographic. Investors now have the rare chance to witness fundamental and technical factors coming together to bring double-digit upside potential on a silver platter. 84% EPS advances during a recession will pale compared to the massive numbers investors can expect once the underlying trends recover.

This has seen sales growing steadily over the months, and the overall scenario looks far better than a year ago. The Commerce Department said earlier this week that retail sales rose in July, driven by solid online sales. E-commerce has been a key player in driving overall retail sales and is projected to play a bigger role in the coming months. Given this situation, retail stocks with a strong online presence, such as Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Travelzoo TZOO, JD.com, Inc. JD and Rover Group, Inc. ROVR, are likely to benefit in the near term. E-Commerce Driving Retail Sales Retail sales rose 0.7% in July to hit $696.4 billion after increasing 0.3% in June, the Commerce Department said on Aug 15. Experts noted that the promotional offers and discounts presented during Amazon Prime Day, which took place in July, probably contributed to an increase in online consumer spending. According to the report, the solid jump in July was driven by a 1.9% rise in online sales. E-commerce has become a preferred choice for millions of Americans over the past three years or since the COVID-19 outbreak. Consumers realized the ease and convenience of shopping online during the peak of the pandemic. E-commerce, thus, was also responsible for saving the retail sector from total collapse during that time. This saw online sales hitting the $1 trillion mark for the first time in 2022, and this year&#039;s figures are expected to grow further. According to the 2023 US Online Retail Report by FTI Consulting, online retail sales are projected to exceed $1.1 trillion in 2023, reflecting a 10% rise from the previous year. This expansion is in line with the continuous upward trend of the e-commerce sector in recent times. Forecasts have indicated that e-commerce sales in the United States are expected to hit $1.6 trillion by 2027.

The takeaway is that NVIDIA is cemented as the leading player in AI during this early phase of the revolution. The company’s chips are the #1 building block for AI-powered and quick-computing applications, where most of the IT money is flowing this year. The question is, is it too late to get on board with this market? Based on three critical factors, this stock could rise at least another 25% before it peaks out, and it will more likely top 50% before the play is through. Get NVIDIA alerts: 50%? Really? This Is How NVIDIA Gets To $750 The simple fact is that NVIDIA is the hottest stock today. As a wise investor said following the Q2 release, it only takes 1 hot report to erase the impact of 4 bad ones; the meaning is that there are many losing trades in the market right now, and bulls are piling into this 1. That alone can push the stock higher, and there is a significant amount of bullishness in the charts. The foundation of the move began last year when the stock began to bottom. The bottom formed a Head & Shoulders pattern that was confirmed as a reversal this year with the rise of AI. The reversal is now augmented by a solid continuation signal pointing the market higher. On a technical basis, it is the Head & Shoulders pattern that matters now. It is a sign of how large this market is, and it is a big market. The H&S reversal is worth $179 in magnitude, a gain of 160% from bottom to neckline. Project that gain from the neckline, 160%, and you get $756 or 51.2% from the post-Q2 release price point of $500. The post-breakout activity backs up that target. The move up from the breakout point topped near $480 and confirmed support at $400, which is good for another 37.5% to 72% advance. When projected from the $400 support level and the $480 high-point, those targets range from $604 to $756, which aligns with the initial target. The average of those targets is good for a gain of 40%. The Results: They Prove NVIDIA Is Winning AI And Its Accelerating NVIDIA’s results are jaw-dropping enough on their own, but then you have to consider how mind-bending the guidance was, the margin of outperformance, and how much stronger than the Marketbeat.com consensus the guidance is. The takeaway is that NVIDIA is not only winning in AI, but the shift is accelerating and may not top out for several quarters.

The critical factor for NVIDIA is that it is not just a chip company but a full-service, full-stack AI workshop that facilitates all levels of the industry. Fundamentally, NVIDIA is AI, and AI is NVIDIA. The Analysts Will Drive NVIDIA Even Higher The analysts have been a driver of NVIDIA’s stock market all year and will continue to do so in 2023 and 2024. The Q2 release and guidance sparked at least 20 revisions within the 1st 12 hours, and the news is all bullish. The 20 picked up by Marketbeat.com’s tracking tools include 3 upgrades to Buy and 18 increased price targets. The range of targets is broad, with a low of $550 and a high of $1100, implying the stock will more than double. The consensus of the new targets is $645, about 30% above the pre-market action, leading the broader consensus higher. This means the market will move higher for investors and traders, but chasing prices may not be a good idea. NVIDIA may make a large surge higher now, but investors with the long game in mind may want to wait for a price pullback before adding to positions because volatility should also be expected. The stock is up more than 400% over the last 12 months and offers a juicy opportunity for current holders to take profits. Should you invest $1,000 in NVIDIA right now?

This rise can be attributed to the overall strength of the tech sector. Notably, several other tech stocks also saw an increase in their trading value, likely influenced by NVIDIA’s impressive second-quarter financial results and positive third-quarter guidance. NVIDIA’s strong financial performance indicates a growing demand for AI technologies, an area in which Microsoft has made significant investments across its product ecosystem. The company has heavily focused on AI in its cloud services, Azure AI, and machine learning tools. The positive outcomes achieved by NVIDIA suggest a thriving market for AI-related hardware, which further supports Microsoft’s AI ambitions. While there are no recent news articles providing a comprehensive explanation of the current state of Microsoft shares, it is worth mentioning that the company’s stock experienced a significant boost on July 18, 2023. On that day, Microsoft’s stock closed with a nearly 4% increase, reaching its highest trading value to date. This impressive performance propelled the company’s market capitalization to new heights. Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Shows Positive Growth on August 23, 2023 On August 23, 2023, Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) experienced a positive day in the stock market. The stock opened at $323.85 and fluctuated between a low of $323.50 and a high of $329.20. The trading volume for the day was 915,290. Microsoft has a market capitalization of $2.4 trillion and has shown positive earnings growth in the last year, this year, and is expected to continue growing over the next five years. The company’s revenue growth in the past year was +6.88%. MSFT showed a positive change of +$5.40, representing a percentage change of +1.34% on August 23, 2023. This increase is a positive indicator for investors. Microsoft is scheduled to report its next earnings on October 25, 2023, with analysts forecasting an EPS of $2.59 for the current quarter. Microsoft reported annual revenue of $211.9 billion in the previous year, with a net profit of $72.4 billion. The company operates in the technology services sector, specifically in the packaged software industry, and is headquartered in Redmond, Washington. Overall, Microsoft’s stock performance on August 23, 2023, was positive, reflecting the company’s strong financials and positive earnings growth. Microsoft Corps Stock Performance and Positive Outlook: Analysts Predict 22.32% Increase in Value On August 23, 2023, Microsoft Corp’s stock performance was closely watched by investors and analysts. According to data from CNN Money, the 42 analysts offering 12-month price forecasts for Microsoft Corp had a median target of $400.00, with a high estimate of $440.00 and a low estimate of $232.00. This median estimate represented a +22.32% increase from the last price of $327.00. The current consensus among 50 polled investment analysts was to buy stock in Microsoft Corp. This rating had held steady since August, indicating a consistent positive sentiment towards the company’s stock. In terms of financial performance, Microsoft Corp reported earnings per share of $2.59 for the current quarter, with sales amounting to $55.0 billion. The company’s next reporting date was scheduled for October 25. The positive outlook for Microsoft Corp’s stock can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the company has a strong track record of innovation and market leadership. Microsoft is known for its flagship products such as Windows, Office, and Azure, which continue to generate significant revenue and maintain a large customer base. Additionally, Microsoft has successfully diversified its business beyond traditional software and hardware, expanding into cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and other emerging technologies. This strategic shift has enabled the company to capture new growth opportunities and remain competitive in a rapidly evolving tech landscape. Furthermore, Microsoft has demonstrated consistent financial performance, with strong revenue growth and profitability. The company’s ability to generate substantial cash flow has allowed it to invest in research and development, make strategic acquisitions, and return value to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. The positive sentiment towards Microsoft Corp’s stock is also reflected in the analyst price targets. The median target of $400.00 represents a significant upside potential of 22.32% from the last price of $327.00. This indicates that analysts believe the stock is undervalued and has room for further growth. However, it is important to note that investing in the stock market carries inherent risks, and past performance is not indicative of future results. Investors should carefully consider their own financial situation, risk tolerance, and investment goals before making any investment decisions. In conclusion, on August 23, 2023, Microsoft Corp’s stock performance was viewed positively by analysts and investors. The company’s strong financial performance, diversified business portfolio, and positive market sentiment have contributed to its favorable outlook. However, investors should conduct thorough research and seek professional advice before making any investment decisions.', 'url': 'https://beststocks.com/microsofts-shares-rise-on-strength-of-tech-se/', 'publish_time': '2023-08-24 00:01:20'}, {'related_code': ['NVDA.O'], 'title': 'The Long-Term Winning High-Multiple Stocks', 'content': 'Nvidia became the highest price-to-sales (P/S) ratio stock in the S&P 500 at the end of March 2023 and up until mid-August 2023, returned a total of 52.6% compared to the S&P 500’s 8.7%.

Justin Sullivan Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) really did and went ahead to pull off a 101% y/y increase to fiscal second quarter revenues, beating its blockbuster guidance to push the stock above $500 a piece in post-market trading. The monstrous quarter was driven primarily by robust AI demand in data center sales – particularly the deployment of “NVIDIA H100 AI infrastructures” – that were up by almost triple of the prior year’s. The blockbuster results were complemented by robust double-digit percentage growth across its consumer-facing gaming and automotive segments, despite a slow consumer backdrop.

NVIDIA AI has emerged as the operating system for all AI systems. It runs on every cloud and supports all frameworks and models. This implies that Nvidia is poised to deliver massive growth due to the rapid adoption of this next-gen tech, leading its stock to new highs. Strengthening this view is the company’s solid Q3 outlook. The company delivered exceptional second-quarter financials and expects revenue of about $16 billion in Q3, representing a year-over-year growth of nearly 170%. Nvidia’s Q3 sales outlook handily surpassed the Street’s expectations of $12.5 billion. The tremendous demand for its accelerated computing and AI platforms will drive Data Center revenues in Q3 and beyond. NVDA’s HGX platform, known as the engine of generative AI and large language models, is witnessing enormous demand from cloud service providers and large consumer Internet companies. Thanks to the secular tailwinds, the company is well-positioned to deliver record revenues and earnings and enhance shareholders’ returns through share buybacks. With Nvidia stock riding high on the AI wave, Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh sees significant upside potential from current levels. Analyst Rakesh Sees Over 25% Upside in NVDA Stock Rakesh raised Nvidia’s price target following its solid Q2 performance and strong outlook. The analyst increased his price target to $590 from $530, implying an upside potential of over 25% from current levels. The analyst expects spending on AI to increase by 10 times in the next five years. With its leadership position in the AI space, Nvidia will benefit significantly from higher investments in this space. He further added that the large addressable market for generative AI could remain a key growth driver for NVDA. With AI spending projected to increase, Rakesh expects Nvidia to “drive 75-90% market share.” Are Nvidia Shares a Buy? Nvidia stock has appreciated quite a lot, but it hasn’t peaked. Analysts maintain a bullish outlook on the stock and see further upside potential. With 34 out of 36 analysts covering the stock recommending a Buy, NVDA stock commands a Strong Buy consensus rating on TipRanks. The average analysts’ price target of $537.38 implies 14.05% upside potential from current levels. Additionally, the highest 12-month price target on NVDA is $800, indicating an impressive 69.79% upside potential. This was given by Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann on August 16, 2023. Investors should note that the average price target is expected to increase as analysts may revise their price targets upward following the company’s massive Q2 beat and solid outlook. The Final Takeaway Thanks to the incredible demand for accelerated computing and AI platforms, Nvidia is poised to deliver massive growth, driving its stock higher to new highs. In addition, the company announced an additional $25 billion stock repurchase plan, highlighting its ability to generate significant cash flows and enhance its shareholders’ value.

Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA) shares closed Wednesday trading at $471.16, up 3.17 percent from the day’s opening price. The NVDA gains extended by about 6.58 percent during the after-hours session to trade at about $502.15. The sudden rise in Nvidia shares was attributed to the announcement of Q2 of fiscal year 2024 financial result that impressed most shareholders. For instance, Nvidia reported a revenue of about $13.51 billion, up approximately 88 percent from the prior quarter, and up over 100 percent from a year ago. During the second quarter, the tech company reported adjusted earnings per share of about $2.70, whereas analysts surveyed by Refinitiv expected $2.09. Additionally, the analyst surveyed by Refinitiv expected the company to report $11.22 billion. The company attributed its exemplary performance during the second quarter to a notable increase in demand for generative AI products. “During the quarter, major cloud service providers announced massive NVIDIA H100 AI infrastructures. Leading enterprise IT systems and software providers announced partnerships to bring NVIDIA AI to every industry. The race is on to adopt generative AI,” Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia. Nvidia Financial Statements in Q2 2024 and Market Outlook In Q2, Nvidia returned $3.38 billion to shareholders in the form of 7.5 million shares repurchased, and cash dividends. Additionally, the company’s Board of Directors approved an additional $25 billion to facilitate the share repurchases. Moreover, the company expects to continue with the share buyback program this year. The company announced a Non-GAAP net income of about $6.74 billion during the second quarter up 148 percent QoQ and over 422 percent YoY. Nvidia attributed its immense growth to the unquenchable demand for artificial intelligence products. “A new computing era has begun. Companies worldwide are transitioning from general-purpose to accelerated computing and generative AI,” Huang added. Notably, NVIDIA GPUs connected by its Mellanox networking and switch technologies and running the CUDA AI software stack make up the computing infrastructure of generative AI. Worth noting that the company’s data center revenues made up the lion’s share with about $10.32 billion, up approximately 141 percent from the first quarter, and up over 170 percent from a year ago. The company’s gaming sector reported revenue of $2.49 billion, up about 11 percent from the previous quarter and up over 20 percent from a year ago.

Einige Marktteilnehmer befürchteten, dass die Erwartungen an den KI-Darling zu hoch sein könnten und dieser nicht ein “Blockbuster”-Quartal nach dem anderen abliefern werde. Im Mai hatte der Konzern die Anlegerwelt bereits verblüfft. Dies gelang ihm schon wieder. Und wie. Trotz schwieriger Konjunktur sieht NVIDIA dank des KI-Hypes auch im kommenden Jahr eine starke Nachfrage nach seinen Grafik-Chips. (Bildquelle: Pressefoto NVIDIA) NVIDIA versetzt US-Börsen in Party-Laune Entsprechend ist es wenig verwunderlich, dass die NVIDIA-Aktie am Mittwochabend im nachbörslichen US-Handel um knapp 7 Prozent in die Höhe schoss. Zumal für NVIDIA inzwischen ganz neue Maßstäbe zu gelten scheinen. In der Regel versuchen Unternehmen, die Erwartungen an das aktuelle Quartal zu übertreffen. NVIDIA hält sich jedoch nicht lange mit der Vergangenheit oder Gegenwart auf. Der Konzern wollte schon einmal mit den aktuellen Zahlen die zukünftigen Erwartungen schlagen. Für das laufende dritte Quartal (Ende Oktober) wollte der Markt Umsätze von 12,5 Mrd. US-Dollar sehen. NVIDIA lieferte bereits im zweiten Quartal (Ende Juli) 13,51 Mrd. US-Dollar an Erlösen ab. Dies ist eine Umsatzsteigerung von 101 Prozent gegenüber dem Vorjahreszeitraum und um 88 Prozent gegenüber dem Vorquartal. Analysten hatten im Schnitt gerade einmal mit 11,04 Mrd. US-Dollar gerechnet. Jetzt werden sie schnell sein müssen, um ihre Prognosen nach oben zu korrigieren. NVIDIA pulverisiert zukünftige Erwartungen jetzt schon NVIDIA peilt für das Oktober-Quartal einen Gesamtumsatz von rund 16 Mrd. US-Dollar an, während Analysten zuletzt im Schnitt schon mit 12,5 Mrd. US-Dollar zufrieden gewesen wären. Besonders im Fokus: Das Geschält mit Rechenzentren und der Nachfrage rund um die zusätzliche für die KI benötigte Rechenkapazität. Hier schossen die Erlöse im abgelaufenen Dreimonatszeitraum im Vorjahresvergleich um 171 Prozent auf 10,32 Mrd. US-Dollar. Die Konsensschätzungen lagen gerade einmal bei 8,0 Mrd. US-Dollar. „Eine neue Ära der Datenverarbeitung hat begonnen. Unternehmen auf der ganzen Welt gehen vom Allzweck-Computing zum beschleunigten Computing und zur generativen Künstlichen Intelligenz über“, sagte Unternehmensgründer Jensen Huang und deutete damit an, dass NVIDIA jetzt so richtig loslegen will. Zumal die Nachfrage trotz schwieriger Konjunktur hoch bleibt und Unternehmen stark in die KI investieren. Der KI-Hype geht weiter Bei all dem Jubel über das Umsatzwachstum, sollte man nicht vergessen, dass die Geschäfte NVIDIAs auch hochprofitabel sind. Im abgelaufenen Quartal wurde der Nettogewinn gegenüber dem Vorjahreszeitraum auf 6,19 Mrd. US-Dollar mehr als verdreifacht. Die Bruttomarge lag bei 70,1 Prozent, nach 64,6 Prozent im Vorjahr und soll laut Unternehmensprognose im laufenden Quartal noch einmal um 50 Basispunkte höher liegen. Bereinigt um Einmaleffekte wurde ein Gewinn je Aktie von 2,70 US-Dollar ausgewiesen. Analysten hatten im Schnitt gerade einmal 2,07 US-Dollar erwartet. Außerdem werden die Anteilseigner mit einer Aufstockung des Aktienrückkaufprogramms um 25 Mrd. US-Dollar erfreut. Bei einem Wachstumsunternehmen könnte man dies als negatives Signal werten, NVIDIA scheint aber genügend Geld zur Hand zu haben, für Investitionen und für Ausschüttungen. Das marktEINBLICKE-Fazit Auch wenn bei NVIDIA immer wieder Sorgen vor einer möglicherweise bald platzenden Blase bestehen, kann man sich dem Hype derzeit kaum entziehen. Zumal das Management betont, dass die Nachfrage auch im kommenden Jahr hoch bleiben wird. Außerdem steht NVIDIA derzeit an der Spitze der Euphorie rund um die Künstliche Intelligenz. Niemand scheint dem Spezialisten für Grafikprozessoren das Wasser reichen zu können. Obwohl NVIDIA derzeit die Nachrichtenlage beherrscht, dürfte der Konzern nicht der einzige sein, der im Chip-Sektor von dem erwarten KI-Boom profitiert.

Are we going to hold? - I think it\'s the absolutely crucial thing,"" said Robert Alster, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management. Wall Street was set to rise, with S&P 500 futures gauges up 0.6%. U.S. stocks ended sharply higher on Wednesday and shares of Nvidia jumped nearly 10% in trading after the bell, hitting an all-time high. The company\'s revenue forecast demonstrated how a boom in generative AI technologies that can read and write in human-like ways - and powered almost exclusively by Nvidia\'s chips - shows no signs of slowing down.

The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes reached 4.21%, compared with its U.S. close of 4.198% on Wednesday, when it eased from near-16-year highs after weak business activity data from the United States and the euro zone. MSCI\'s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 1.5% higher, also lifted by Nvidia\'s bullish outlook. Still, the index is down about 8% so far this month due to weakness in China\'s economy and yuan, as well as some gloomy factory readings from Japan, which also left sentiment fragile. China stocks also rebounded on Thursday, however, with the blue-chip CSI300 index advancing 0.7%. In currency markets, the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six other major currencies, added 0.2%, and remains higher over the month. The euro edged down 0.1% against the dollar, which earlier nursed some losses against Asian currencies, clipped by the softer-than-expected global economic data.

The report indicates that the company’s data center division achieved a staggering $10.32 billion in revenue, marking a remarkable quarter-on-quarter growth of 141 percent and a year-on-year increase of 171 percent. This exponential growth has heightened the company’s optimism about its future prospects. The driving force behind NVIDIA’s remarkable revenue surge is believed to be its data center’s AI server-related solutions. Key products like AI-accelerated GPUs and the AI server HGX reference architecture have played a pivotal role in establishing NVIDIA as a foundational player in AI infrastructure for large data centers. Industry analysts at TrendForce anticipate that NVIDIA will further consolidate its software and hardware resources. The company is expected to strategically align its high-end, mid-tier, and entry-level GPU AI accelerator chips with Original Design Manufacturers (ODMs) and Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), fostering a collaborative system certification model. This approach is poised to expedite the deployment of Cloud Service Provider (CSP) cloud AI server infrastructures. Additionally, NVIDIA’s collaboration with entities such as VMware on solutions like the Private AI Foundation is projected to extend its reach into the edge enterprise AI server market, fueling steady growth in its data center business over the next couple of years. NVIDIA’s Data Center Business Dominates Market Share, Fueled by Cloud AI Demand In recent years, NVIDIA has been diligently expanding its data center business. Initially trailing its gaming segment, data center revenue has surged, overtaking gaming revenue. This shift has been accelerated by significant investments from major CSPs in AI services and ChatBOTS for public cloud infrastructures. As a result, NVIDIA’s data center revenue share has surged to over 76 percent in the latest fiscal quarter. NVIDIA Targets Both Cloud and Edge Data Center AI Markets TrendForce’s observations reveal a strategic shift in NVIDIA’s approach to high-end GPU products in the latter half of 2023. While the company has traditionally focused on top-tier AI servers equipped with A100 and H100 GPUs, positive market demand is expected to drive NVIDIA to prioritize the higher-priced H100 GPU, effectively boosting its data center-related revenue growth. At the same time, NVIDIA is emphasizing its L40s GPU as a flagship product for mid-tier applications. This shift is underpinned by its use of GDDR memory, allowing for rapid deployment to the mid-tier AI server market. The L40s GPU is tailored to enterprise customers with needs that may not require the high parameter counts of larger models like ChatGPT. It is expected to excel in compact AI training applications and edge AI inference tasks. Moreover, the L40s could serve as an alternative solution in regions where geopolitical factors might disrupt the supply of high-end GPUs. HGX and MGX AI Server Reference Architectures Drive NVIDIA’s AI Solutions Strategy NVIDIA’s strategy extends beyond refining its core AI chip GPU. The company is actively promoting its HGX and MGX solutions, capitalizing on its integration of GPU and CUDA platform to establish a comprehensive AI ecosystem. This strategy has positioned NVIDIA with considerable influence over server supply chains, encouraging ODMs and OEMs to adopt NVIDIA’s reference designs. However, they must undergo a hardware and software certification process. By bundling integrated solutions, including Arm CPU Grace, NPU, and AI Cloud Foundation, NVIDIA aims to expand its AI business aggressively to Tier-2 data centers and edge enterprise clients. Despite its success, NVIDIA faces intensifying competition from CSPs adopting in-house ASIC AI accelerator chips. To counter this, NVIDIA continues to diversify its GPU offerings and comprehensive solutions, aiming to penetrate Tier-2 data centers and edge enterprise markets.', 'url': 'https://infotechlead.com/data-center/nvidia-reports-remarkable-growth-in-data-center-business-in-latest-financial-results-80195', 'publish_time': '2023-08-24 13:23:44'}, {'related_code': ['NVDA.O'], 'title': 'Nvidia Posts Blowout Quarter, But Market Rout Quashes Rally', 'content': 'WATCH: Nvidia said sales will be about $16 billion in the three months ending in October.

Justin Sullivan Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Stock Price Today, Quote & News) has just released its FY 2024 Q2 results as Seeking Alpha has covered here. This was one of the most highly anticipated earnings report that I recall, so much that this Seeking Alpha news item linked Nvidia\'s earnings to global markets being higher (not cause and effect per se but just the two events being linked in the same headline conveys the point). I recently previewed Nvidia\'s Q2, calling this earnings report a ""market direction decider"". While these are early hours, the market direction is likely to be up in the short-term as Nvidia\'s stock was up nearly 10% after hours, breaching the historical $500 mark for the first time.

However, while maintaining my bullish perspective, I did not anticipate Nvidia to quintuple in about ten months. Unfortunately, I sold my Nvidia shares prematurely, after only about a 100-200% gain, and have been unable to find an appropriate pullback to get back in.

Wedbush Securities’ Dan Ives described it as a monumental moment for tech, equating Nvidia’s AI prowess to epoch-making events like the Internet’s rise in 1995 and the iPhone’s debut in 2007. Ives emphasized that investors should be looking at this AI trend with a long-term lens, akin to generational shifts in tech. Looking ahead, Nvidia projects a bullish $16 billion in third-quarter sales, overshooting analysts’ estimates. This upbeat trajectory led several analysts to up their targets: Rosenblatt’s Hans Mosesmann bumped his price target to a staggering $1,100, citing the shift to accelerated computing. Others like KeyBanc’s John Vinh and WestPark’s Kevin Garrigan also boosted their targets, celebrating the results that exceeded even the loftiest expectations. And while expectations were high, BMO’s Ambrish Srivastava noted that wasn’t an issue at all for Nvidia. What is the Fair Value of Nvidia Stock? Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Strong Buy consensus rating on NVDA stock based on 39 Buys, one Hold, and zero Sells assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic above.

What happened Shares of Applied Digital (APLD 1.73%) saw big sell-offs in Thursday\'s trading. The data-center services stock closed out the daily session down 12%, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes ended the day down 1.4% and 1.9%, respectively. The market saw an uptick in bearish momentum today following the publication of Nvidia\'s second-quarter earnings report, and Applied Digital participated in the pullback. Interestingly, Nvidia actually reported fantastic Q2 results. So what Following Nvidia\'s fantastic second-quarter release, investors are worried that the big bull run for artificial intelligence (AI) stocks may have run its course. The graphics-processing-unit (GPU) leader crushed earnings expectations for the period, reporting earnings per share of $2.70 on sales of $13.51 billion. For comparison, the average analyst estimate had guided for per-share earnings of $2.09 and revenue of $11.22 billion. Nvidia also guided for roughly $16 billion in revenue in the current quarter, far ahead of the average analyst estimate\'s call for sales of $12.61 in the period. But despite the excellent Q2 results and guidance, Nvidia stock ended the day up just 0.5%. Given the magnitude of its sales, earnings, and guidance beats, the weak gains in Thursday\'s session are sending a worrying signal. Applied Digital and many other stocks that have seen big gains this year thanks to excitement surrounding AI saw outsized sell-offs as the market reassessed valuations for artificial intelligence companies. The data-center company had recently gotten a boost after receiving ""elite partner"" status within the Nvidia Partner Network, and shareholders may have been particularly skittish after the GPU leader\'s results didn\'t translate into big share price gains. Now what Despite today\'s big pullback for the stock, Applied Digital has rallied roughly 225% year to date. The impressive run has been driven by strong sales growth and optimism about the company\'s opportunities to provide data-center services for artificial intelligence and other high-performance computing applications. After such big gains, it\'s possible that Applied Digital will continue to see substantial valuation pullbacks if investors broadly become more cautious about AI stocks. The market\'s tepid response to Nvidia\'s blockbuster Q2 results and guidance seem to signal that investor excitement surrounding AI is cooling off -- at least temporarily.', 'url': 'https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/08/24/why-applied-digital-stock-plummeted-today/', 'publish_time': '2023-08-24 20:45:58'}]",,112.825772,97.892949,48.841813,,35.645362,"News 1:

Content: Oct. 16—INDIANAPOLIS — Costco Wholesale Corp. cannot be held liable for the fentanyl-related death of an employee who bought the drug from another co-worker in a transaction that did not occur at the store, the Indiana Court of Appeals has ruled. A lawsuit was filed against Costco and an employee by Bobby Timbrook whose son Maxwell, 28, of Whitestown, died of fentanyl intoxication in 2020.

DBGI Stock Performance on September 5, 2023: Fluctuations and Low Trading Volume DBGI stock had a mixed performance on September 5, 2023. The stock opened at $11.47 and fluctuated between $11.38 and $23.72 throughout the day. The trading volume was 34,394 shares, significantly lower than the average volume over the past three months. DBGI has a market capitalization of $3.4 million, indicating that it is a relatively small company. The company’s earnings growth in the previous year was 80.18%, but there is no data available for the current year or the next five years. The company’s revenue growth in the last year was 84.20%, but it reported an annual profit of -$38.0 million, resulting in a net profit margin of -272.30%. This suggests that the company is operating at a loss. DBGI operates in the consumer non-durables sector, specifically in the apparel/footwear industry. There is no information available regarding the company’s executives or its corporate headquarters. There is also no data available for DBGI’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio or its price-to-book ratio, which are commonly used by investors to assess a stock’s valuation. Overall, based on the limited information provided, it is difficult to make a definitive assessment of DBGI’s stock performance on September 5, 2023. The stock had significant fluctuations in price and low trading volume. The company is currently operating at a loss despite strong revenue growth in the previous year. Assessing DBGI Stock Performances on September 5, 2023: The Importance of Specific Data and Reliable Sources DBGI stock performances on September 5, 2023 are difficult to assess without specific data on earnings per share and sales. Without information on earnings per share, it is impossible to determine the profitability of the company during the current quarter. Similarly, without information on sales, it is challenging to assess the company’s revenue generation. Additionally, the reporting date is listed as “TBD,” meaning that there is no specific date provided for when the company will release its financial results for the current quarter. Given the lack of specific data, it is advisable for investors and stakeholders to closely monitor the company’s announcements and financial updates. Investors should rely on reliable sources such as CNN Money for accurate and up-to-date information. In conclusion, without specific data on earnings per share, sales, and a reporting date, it is challenging to provide a comprehensive analysis of DBGI stock performances on September 5, 2023.', 'url': 'https://beststocks.com/options-trades-and-investor-sentiments-on-jdc/', 'publish_time': '2023-09-05 19:50:48'}]",35.829625,17.905633,7.441908,1.762984,0.355475,0.36547,"News 1:

We are very fast. We are agile. Of course, we can always get better, but for this size of a company, it\'s amazing."" The key to the future: R&D In fast-changing business and tech environments, standing still is akin to death. So, keeping a relentless focus on innovation to meet future demands is critical. That’s where research and development come in. Innovation depends on constant experimentation and deep insights into what is needed in society and business — and what is possible, even if it seems nearly impossible. Cisco’s network of innovation centers, which spans 11 cities around the globe, spurs out-of-the-box thinking and co-innovation across far-flung regions. But it is but one area in which the company invests in new ideas. “We invest very heavily in innovation,” said Scott Herren, Cisco’s executive vice president and chief financial officer. “There’s different types of innovation. But let’s stick with product innovation for a moment. We spend about $17 billion a year in total OPEX. R&D is one of the biggest drivers of that. That’s going into substantial innovation.” Herren cited the groundbreaking Silicon One chip, as one example of intensive R&D investments in action, with its great advancements in speed, flexibility, and energy savings. “Silicon One is our own chip set that is driving significantly faster throughput,” Herren said. “It combines what previously had been multiple chips into a single chip set. That chip set is not only faster throughout, but designed for substantially less power consumption. So, it’s more competitive. Customers look at not just what’s the acquisition price, but what’s it going cost to run this after three, four or five years.” A close eye on customer needs Understanding those ever-changing customer needs, Tuszik stressed, stems from close relationships across a vast, global partner ecosystem. Cisco’s partners represent a vast array of industries and offer their own innovative ideas, while providing a close eye on ever-changing customer demands — for technology that’s more powerful but simpler to implement and manage; products that support customers’ own sustainability goals, and for integrated security that’s built in from the earliest design stages. “Together with our extended partner network, we are even more agile, even more adaptable,” said Tuszik. “We need our partners, because they can be more innovative in certain segments. They can serve special, vertical needs. They can serve local needs. So, when we are talking about innovation together with our partners, we are able to serve all the areas of innovation from technology over to go-to-market motion, to consumption motion and to adapting to the needs that our customers have right now.” Jonathan Davidson, executive vice president and general manager of the Cisco networking team, concurs. He sees innovation as an outside-in, customer-driven proposition. “Make sure you’ve got clear objectives,” he explained, “and start from the outside in, with our customers’ biggest challenges. How can we go and help them solve those greatest challenges in an innovative way? And then organize to do that in the most rapid fashion.” Lifelong learners Will Townsend, vice president and principal analyst, Networking and Security at Moor Insights and Strategy, stressed Cisco’s emphasis on constant upskilling — both from within the company and beyond, by creating new opportunities around the world. “I’m impressed with the investment that the company continues to make in upskilling, in training, and certification,” Townsend said. “It’s your investment in Networking Academy, your investment in DevNet for the developer community that really sets you apart. Obviously, you’ve been the gold standard with respect to engineering certifications.” Fran Katsoudas, Cisco’s executive vice president and chief people, policy, and purpose office, cites that devotion to constant evolution, change, and professional growth as a key element of an innovative culture — but admits it’s not without its challenges. “It’s going to be so important to understand today, what are the skills that we have and against the backdrop of what we want to do, what are the skills that we need to build?” she said. “And the magic comes in really helping people connect to the training, to the experiences, to making the time to really focus on that. I think one of the biggest changes is that we’re all going to be constantly learning and relearning. Sometimes I see that people are nervous about how roles are changing, and what I think we have to do is really leap into it.” Getting acquisitions right With highly successful acquisitions like Meraki, ThousandEyes, and AppDynamics, to name but a few, Cisco has been adept at absorbing innovative startups without undermining the qualities that made them successful in the first place. The goal is always to create a win-win: Cisco influences and scales the startups as they, in turn, impact the larger company. Will Townsend highlights how Meraki’s simpler-to-operate, cloud-based networking technologies have impacted the design of Cisco’s flagship Catalyst switches and routers. “One of the core reasons why Cisco acquired Meraki,” he said, “was the cloud native architecture and the cloud-management capabilities. Catalyst was strictly on premise. But now Meraki has infused itself into the core Cisco portfolio.” The flip side is Cisco’s influence on Meraki. For example, Meraki products are beginning to feature Cisco’s powerful, energy-saving Silicon One chip, which until recently was found only in mass-scale infrastructure products. It’s a great example of home-grown Cisco innovation that’s having an impact on capabilities and sustainability around the world. Protecting the Mojo Acquisitions are sometimes likened to Star Trek’s Borg Collective, a massive alien entity that absorbs entire planetary cultures while destroying their identities. But Townsend applauds Cisco’s merger of cultures, which encourages the smaller companies to maintain their unique identities. “With your acquisition of ThousandEyes,” he explained, “you’ve allowed that team to continue to innovate. It’s brought internet visibility to the Cisco portfolio, and it’s been integrated into the Cisco portfolio quite effectively. Cisco hasn’t done anything to, to quote Austin Powers, ‘kill the mojo’. You’ve allowed them to innovate in their own way.” Mohit Lad, senior vice president and general manager of Cisco Networking Assurance, is co-founder of ThousandEyes, which is a highly innovative leader in cloud and internet intelligence – delivering visibility beyond the on-prem environment. He believes that his company has been able to retain and scale innovation even more since it was acquired in 2020. “ThousandEyes head count has doubled in size since the acquisition and a lot of that growth is based on talent joining from Cisco. When an acquired company continues to innovate, it is actually a great thing,” Lad said. “And it is very rare in the industry. It is something intentional by Cisco, which means Cisco is also innovating because they are empowering an acquisition to thrive, even more than before.” “The fact that Meraki is innovating 10 years after the acquisition,” he added, “it’s Cisco innovating.” Ronak Desai became SVP and GM for AppDynamics and full-stack observability, following Cisco’s acquisition of AppDynamics in 2017. He too applauds Cisco’s ability to help startups scale their businesses, while supporting their agile, innovative cultures. “We got a big lift because of Cisco’s customer reach,” he said. “And their fantastic sales team helped us scale the business. Part of the greatness with Cisco is it’s so easy to preserve the good things about your culture from a startup perspective. Because Cisco thinks like a startup, and it cares about its people.” Lad also cites a solid cultural alignment with Cisco, along with access to Cisco innovations in areas like predictive analytics and SD-WAN. “Cisco opened up the operating system,” Lad said, “and with the next-generation technology they were using, enabled us to seamlessly deploy ThousandEyes in environments that we had not considered before. For us, data is a huge currency, and being able to collect data seamlessly from different parts of the environment was really interesting. So, we started to think about how we could leverage ThousandEyes differently, and along with the things that Cisco was very good at, including SD-WAN environments, etc. We were combining our efforts, with the incubation that happened inside Cisco around this broader umbrella of predictive networks.” No one said it would be easy Of course, in an organization of more than 80,000 people, speed and agility does not always come naturally — and challenges persist. Silos are one issue the company is trying to address. Grace Francisco, VP of developer relations strategy, spoke of the company’s ongoing efforts to integrate technologies and ensure that separate units, especially those that were acquired as startups, function together, in a more holistic manner. As part of Cisco’s API First strategy, for example, Francisco’s team has pushed for more compatibility among separate products. “Our first step towards an API first strategy is backwards compatibility for all of our major products,” she said. “That’s a really major step forward in terms of the consistency and quality of what our partners and developers expect from us today. And that is difficult. Because of the way that all of our groups have been treated as silos over the many years. For us to transform as a company, we need to get to much more standardized processes, quality initiatives, and practices.” Which is to say, there’s little time for self-congratulation. Innovation and speed can never be taken for granted. And as Mohit Lad stressed, fast never seems to be fast enough. “We’ve continued to innovate,” he said, “but I always believed, even as a startup, it could be moving faster. So that won’t change. I always feel like, hey, couldn’t we be moving faster?”', 'url': 'https://newsroom.cisco.com/c/r/newsroom/en/us/a/y2023/m05/global-but-agile-startup-speed-in-a-large-enterprise.html', 'publish_time': '2023-05-02 12:00:00'}, {'related_code': ['CSCO.O'], 'title': 'Cisco at RSAConference™ 2023', 'content': 'Thank you for joining us in San Francisco for RSAC 2023.

Title: Global but agile: startup speed in a large enterprise
Content: Large organizations sometimes respond to disruptions with the agility of an ocean liner avoiding an iceberg. But even global companies can remain highly innovative and responsive to fast-changing customer needs. With attributes like a highly creative, “fail-fast” culture, bold investments in R&D; and innovation centers, and a smart, focused acquisition strategy, Cisco is one such company.
